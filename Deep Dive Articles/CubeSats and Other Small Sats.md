# CubeSats and Other Small Sats

## Introduction

Within the last two decades, _CubeSats and other small satellites_ (also known as _SmallSats_) have been gaining ground in the space industry due to the ongoing miniaturization of electronics. However, the overall popularity of artificial satellites has been rapidly growing ever since 1957, when the first satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched into the Earth’s orbit by the Soviet Union. From then on, about 8,900 satellites have been placed into orbit and more than 3,000 of them are still operating in outer space today.

These spacecraft differ greatly in size and shape. Therefore, the satellites that have a relatively low mass of up to 500kg are called _small satellites,_ and CubeSats are their subclass with specific predefined characteristics and a cube-like shape. The small satellites have been gaining lots of popularity recently, as numbers show. Namely, small satellite launches have grown from less than 50 a year in 2011 to around 325 in 2020 - over a 500% increase in around a decade.

But what the fuss is all about? Keep on reading to learn more about these spacecraft, their differences with the traditional satellites, their applications, where they can be bought, how they can be sent into space, and other interesting details.

## What are CubeSats and SmallSats?

The satellites can be categorized with regard to different parameters, one of which is their mass. In that manner, they can be divided into three subcategories:

- **Large satellites** – weighing over 1,000kg
- **Medium-sized satellites** – from 500kg to 1,000kg
- **Small satellites** – ranging from less than 1kg to 500kg

Most of the time, the large and medium satellites are referred to as conventional satellites. However, these spacecraft are big, slow, and costly, thus the need for a more optimal alternative has arisen. That is why small satellites have been brought into the game. A CubeSat is a type of small satellite that has been used exclusively in low Earth orbit until a few years ago, with [Mars Cube One (MarCO)](https://www.space.com/29489-marco-cubesats-mars-landing-2016.html) being the first CubeSat to leave our planet on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018.

The compactness of the small satellites, their low price, and short development time have made space exploration more accessible to companies of all types and sizes; a privilege that was reserved only for a few countries and multinationals for a long period of time. Despite their various benefits, they have downsides as well: a rather small lifespan, tiny electronics, and petite size. Specifically, the smaller electronics carry the risk of higher radiation sensitivity, while their size prevents them from carrying a large payload which is sometimes necessary. Hence, the choice of the satellite type greatly depends on the particular project needs, specifications and requirements.

## Types of small satellites

All small satellites are being utilized in a similar manner and are mostly used for _low earth orbit (LEO) space research_. However, there are several different types of small satellites, differentiated once again according to their mass. More specifically, the distinguishable subcategories of the small satellites are:

- Minisatellite: 150–500 kg
- Microsatellite: 10–150 kg
- Nanosatellite: 1–10 kg
- Picosatellite: 0.1–1 kg
- Femtosatellite: below 0.1 kg

### CubeSats

It all started in 1999, when two university professors, Jordi Puig-Suari and Bob Twiggs, proposed the CubeSat design for the purpose of affordable university researches into space. In an interview for Spaceflight, Twiggs said:

>“It all started as a university education program satellite. It was kind of funny. I didn't think that people would criticize it as much as they did, but we got a lot of feedback, you know, "That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Nobody's going to use this toy." We said, "Who the heck cares. We'll go ahead and use it. We're using it for education.”

Soon enough, since in the spacecraft industry every gram costs money, these satellites were brought into vogue due to their small size and thus, low price. If we are to evaluate their popularity with regard to the number of deployments throughout the years, we will come across interesting statistics. Namely, between 1999 and 2012, only 76 CubeSats were deployed, while in the following 8 years, that number has grown drastically - totaling 1257 CubeSats being deployed up to January 2021.

CubeSats are a type of nanosatellites built from one or more cubic units. The dimensions of one cubic unit _(1U)_ are 10x10x10 cm, with a mass of somewhere between 1 and 1.33 kg. Even though the “standard” CubeSat uses only one unit, larger CubeSats _(1.5U, 2U, 3U, 6U, 12U)_ can be built by multiplying the cubic unit. As technology advances, the possibility of even smaller satellites has emerged. Such satellites are the _PocketQubes_ – spacecraft consisting of 5cm cubes instead of the 10cm cubes of the CubeSats. The concept of PocketCubes was first introduced in 2009 and up until now, 10 satellites of this kind have been launched in total. 

The future of cube satellites is promising as even smaller spacecraft, TubeSats and SunCubes, are on the way. _TubeSats_ are in the shape of a tube, with 12.7 cm in length, 8.9 cm in diameter, and a weight of 0.75kg. The first two were launched in 2016, but the first orbital launch has been delayed for over 7 years. _SunCubes_ are even smaller cubes whose unit dimensions are 3x3x3 cm. Even though there hasn’t been a SubCube launch yet, it is estimated that the cost will be around 3,000$ for a flight into low Earth orbit, which means that even garage hobbyists will be able to fly their own missions.

Most of the CubeSats are launched in low circular or elliptical orbit, at altitudes of between 400 and 650 km, and travel with an approximate speed of 8km per second. A CubeSat with these parameters can orbit the Earth 14 to 16 times in one day. In most cases, these satellites are launched into space on rockets and in order to successfully orbit, their speed has to be balanced by the pull of Earth's gravity. Theoretically, they can remain in orbit indefinitely, due to the lack of friction. In reality, however, they do get destroyed after some time, either because the solar arrays stop working or because they run out of fuel. When they come to the end of their operational life, **they re-enter the atmosphere and disintegrate.**

These spacecraft have many advantages over conventional satellites. Some of the most important ones are:

- **Lower price** – while a conventional satellite can cost somewhere between 100 and 300 million euros, a CubeSat usually costs less than 500,000 euros.
- **Smaller size** – their compactness guarantees smaller costs for launching the satellite, as well as more space in the rocket for some additional satellites as well.
- **Faster development time** - a conventional satellite requires between 5 and 15 years to be developed and put into orbit, whereas the required time for a small satellite is around 8 months, which is a drastic time improvement.

## Small satellite application

Small satellites have various applications in a wide spectrum of fields. They are nowadays very accessible and hence extensively used by lots of companies in the space industry. Some of the small satellite applications are:

- **Earth observation** – the observation of the Earth is highly beneficial since it gathers information that helps in weather forecasting, environmental hazards evaluation, climate understanding, navigation systems, etc.
- **IoT and communications** – the satellites have helped greatly in the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to them, we now can communicate with people from the other side of the world either through our mobile phones or the internet. Building small satellite constellations play a key role in IoT advancement.
- **Geolocation and Logistics** – the aforementioned constellations provide easy and immediate monitoring of assets (vehicles, ships, aircraft, etc.) in areas with no land cover.
- **Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)** - the monitoring of the radioelectric and electromagnetic spectrum, which can be done with these small satellites, is crucial for providing initial information in an event of a disaster.

These spacecraft also have numerous applications in the fields of science, environment, security, space exploration, etc. If you would like to know more about the different ways these satellites are being used, you can check out our “about satellites” (hyperlink) article.

## How to make a satellite or buy a satellite

The good thing about the small satellites is that they can be bought online straight off the shelf. There exist various web pages that sell small satellites for as little as 50,000$, which is quite inexpensive when compared to the at least ten times higher price of the traditional satellites.

Another extremely possible but not trivial option, however, is to build your own small satellite from scratch in case you have the time, expertise, and enthusiasm needed. Lots of DIY tutorials can be found on the internet with a step-by-step explanation of the procedure and the possible bottlenecks, but you would still need to do thorough research on the parts needed for the specific mission you want to do. The most optimal option would be to buy a kit with the essential parts and customize the rest of your spacecraft. A company named “Pumpkin” offers CubeSat Kit for a starting price of 7,500$. This kit contains a development board, software libraries, flight model, pluggable processor modules, desktop power supplies, drop-in support for popular transceivers, and additional development tools. However, you would need to additionally buy a power source, payload, transceiver, and antenna, since they are not included in the kit for the sake of customization. The final product would cost you around 25,000$, which means that building your own satellite is much cheaper than simply buying one.

Buying or building a satellite is yet not enough for the success of your space mission. The next step would be to test your spacecraft and finally launch it. There exist several private companies that do exactly that – get your satellite in a rocket and put it into space. The average launch cost of a CubeSat is estimated at around 40,000$. However, the determining factor for the exact price, as well as the available launch vehicle is its mass.

It is extremely hard to determine the launch timelines and total lifespan of the small satellites beforehand since they primarily depend on the type of the satellite and its payload. There exist three different possible launches: _dedicated launch_ where the launch vehicle is exclusively used for that satellite, _rideshare launch_ where satellites with similar payloads share a vehicle and mutually agree on the orbit_,_ and _piggyback launch_ where the satellite is a secondary payload and the destination orbit and launch schedule is determined by the first payload’s requirements. In the case of small satellites, the first option is mostly disregarded as it is considered overkill. The largest portion of the small satellites is launched into LEO, where they stay for about 1 to 2 years before decay. Some of the most well-known companies that can launch your spacecraft into space are NanoRacks, SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Open Cosmos, and Blue Origin. As the space industry grows rapidly, more and more companies enter the business wanting a piece of the pie.

Apart from scheduling a launch vehicle, you’ll need a couple of licenses in order to get your spacecraft in space. More specifically, you’ll have to ensure that you comply with the following satellite regulations:

- **Radio Frequency Regulation** – since the mission’s success depends heavily on the avoidance of harmful interference, appropriate frequency coordination is essential. The license for commercial spacecraft communication is granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and it dictates the band of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be used by the satellite. The frequency bands that have been allocated so far are between 9 kHz and 275 GHz.
- **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Chapter IIII** – The regulations in this chapter are based on the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. The license requests are evaluated with regard to two different reviews: Safety Review and Mission Review. In order to get safety approval, applicants must show that they have the equipment necessary to safely prepare and deploy a launch vehicle and any payload it will carry. The mission approval is granted unless any aspect of the proposed launch poses a danger to US national security or foreign policy interests, poses a risk to public health and safety or property safety, or is inconsistent with US international obligations.
- **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)** - ITAR regulates the export of national-security-related technology and data. The ITAR licenses are directed by the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.
- **Export Administration Regulations (EAR)** – this department controls technologies and data whose commercial export could lead to military applications by other countries. An outline of the types of technologies that require a license can be found on the Commerce Control List.
- **Licensing of Private Remote Sensing Space Systems** – the operation of private space systems is licensed by the Department of Commerce. More specifically, this department takes care of the elimination of some system operation restrictions, the prohibition of imposing conditions by the government once they have issued a license, and consideration of remote sensing data that is planned or usable.

## Conclusion

It is as clear as day that the small satellites are quickly taking over the satellite industry and paving the way for smaller companies and individuals to have their fair share of various space missions. This comes as no surprise considering the numerous benefits and huge range of applications of these spacecraft. And their future is bright as well, as around 8,000 small satellites are expected to be launched within the next 7 years.
