# AI in Industry

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that has been around for a long time. Actually, an astonishing succession of mankind's most prominent philosophers, mathematicians, computer scientists, theoreticians, and psychologists have kicked around the fundamentals of AI throughout the years, whether accidentally or purposefully.

However, AI has climbed the charts only within the last few decades, mostly due to the increased volume of data, advanced algorithms, and computing power and storage improvements1. Along the way to popularity, AI has had lots of significant ups and downs– in fact, there were times where the people who were working in this field were considered dreamers and its reputation was greatly damaged.

So, when it all really started?

In the paper "[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)", written by Alan Turing in 1950, he poses a rather simple question – “can machines think?”. This query would spark the interest of many other great minds who will, later on, provide fertile ground for the development of AI and its advancement. So, in this sense, AI is a computer science branch that aims to answer affirmative to Turing’s question.

Keep on reading to find out more about the field of artificial intelligence - its definition, types, sub-fields, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.

## What is AI

Defining artificial intelligence has never been a trivial task. In fact, even today, it is rather difficult to give a simple and straightforward definition; this is mostly due to the lack of adequate and concise explanations of what intelligence itself means.

The word intelligence is derived from the Latin word intellegentia, which would literally translate to "choosing between". So, intelligence can be interpreted in many ways, but it can be ultimately defined as the ability to solve and answer a variety of problems and questions regardless of their nature, the ability to deal with unknown, unexpected, or unforeseen situations, and the overall process of thinking and reasoning. However, there are still many questions that remain unanswered when it comes to intelligence and the capabilities of the human brain. The word artificial is also derived from Latin, and it translates as something not natural, therefore man-made.

So, while we pose the question of what artificial intelligence actually is, let’s take a look at some of its most widely accepted definitions:

- The science which deals with the study of mental abilities via computer models
- A series of techniques that produce an abundance of sound reasoning and attempt to emulate the mental abilities of ordinary humans
- The science which creates systems that can be identified with human intelligent behavior
- Computer science dealing with the ability to achieve all possible intelligent goals

The birth of the field of artificial intelligence was denoted in 1956 at the [Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence (AI) conference](file:///C:\Users\graci\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\3.%09https:\250.dartmouth.edu\highlights\artificial-intelligence-ai-coined-dartmouth) which was organized by John McCarthy, also known as the father of AI. Namely, he and his small team of scientists gathered for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence that same year, and the idea behind it was “to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”  

This conference proposed a whole different way of thinking and has thus greatly affected research and development in many fields such as mathematics, engineering, and computer science.  

## How does AI work?

The general purpose of AI is to enable computers to perform various cognitive tasks belonging to a broad spectrum of areas in a similar manner as a human would do, without being explicitly programmed to do so. For this to happen, an appropriate AI algorithm has to be defined, implemented, and fed with a sufficient quantity of good-quality, clean data.

However, each one of AI’s subdomains works in a relatively different way. So, in order to understand how AI works as a whole, we should briefly go through [how some of the most well-known AI subdomains work](https://medium.com/@mygreatlearning/what-is-artificial-intelligence-how-does-ai-work-and-future-of-it-d6b113fce9be):

- [Machine Learning](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained) (ML) – is a subfield of artificial intelligence that is mostly used for making predictions and data classification. The ML algorithms analyze past experiences and based on the inferred knowledge, they make calculated decisions without having to rely on the human experience. ML starts with data, which is gathered and prepared in order to be used as training data. After that, the AI experts choose a ML model, supply the data and let the computer learn independently by identifying patterns and correlations. This trained model can, later on, be used for solving similar tasks on datasets it has never seen before.
- [Deep Learning](https://flatironschool.com/blog/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning) (DL) – it is a subfield of machine learning which requires larger volumes of data as well as more computational power, but less ongoing human intervention. The deep learning techniques are based on “deep neural networks”, which are networks consisting of artificial neurons that are trying to imitate the neurons in the human brain.
- [Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing) (NLP) – this field of AI deals with the human language, i.e. it helps machines process, understand, and interpret it. Some of the most important tasks that NLP deals with are speech recognition, part of speech tagging, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, etc. It actually uses machine learning and deep learning models in order to achieve this, and the overall workflow of the NLP techniques is the same as the one of ML and DL
- [Computer Vision](https://serokell.io/blog/guide-to-computer-vision) – Once again, the algorithms used in this field are basically deep learning models, only this time working with image data. Their main goal is to train computers to perceive and interpret visual information from the real world by using pattern recognition.

## Types of artificial intelligence

The field of artificial intelligence is very extensive and complex, so when it comes to its types, it comes as no surprise that there exist several different ways in which it can be classified. Yet, the most widely accepted categorization of Ai divides the whole domain into three separate classes:

- [Artificial Narrow Intelligence](https://codebots.com/artificial-intelligence/the-3-types-of-ai-is-the-third-even-possible) (ANI) – this type of AI is also called weak AI and refers to systems that can perform only a single task but in a very accurate manner, such as playing chess, predicting the weather, or recommending a product for e-commerce. They have a very limited or narrow range of competencies since they can only perform what they are programmed to do and are very far away from having human-like intelligence. In other words, they lack consciousness, reasoning, planning, problem-solving, emotional knowledge, and self-awareness.
- [Artificial General Intelligence](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-4b2a4ab31180) (AGI) –This type of AI (also known as strong AI) has not been achieved yet and there is still a long way to go. The goal of these intelligent machines is to have the same wide-ranging capabilities as humans do, i.e. to be able to autonomously, perceive, communicate, understand, and function at least, as well as humans, can. AGI is still considered just a theoretical concept, so there is a long way to go until these systems actually become a reality.
- [Artificial Super Intelligence](https://medium.com/mapping-out-2050/distinguishing-between-narrow-ai-general-ai-and-super-ai-a4bc44172e22) (ASI) – Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher, [defined superintelligence](https://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html) as “any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest”. Many people are worried that this type of AI might pose a major threat to the human race, as superintelligent machines are to be more powerful than humans in all aspects ranging from creativity to problem-solving, and at the same time, they won’t be controllable. However, there is nothing to worry about yet, since ASI is not something that will happen anytime soon.

## Examples of AI in industry

It is a fact that industry can benefit greatly from artificial intelligence and companies that have realized this and implemented AI within their workflow are already seeing the results. According to a recent [McKinsey Global Survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Artificial%20Intelligence/Global%20AI%20Survey%20AI%20proves%20its%20worth%20but%20few%20scale%20impact/Global-AI-Survey-AI-proves-its-worth-but-few-scale-impact.pdf), the percentage of AI usage in standard business processes grows nearly 25% every year. The majority of CEOs (63%) whose firms have used AI say it has increased revenue in the business sectors where it has been utilized, and 44% say it has decreased expenses as well. All in all, the findings indicate that AI is providing significant value to businesses. Although artificial intelligence can be integrated within every industry, some of its most specifics uses are in the fields of:

- [Manufacturing](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/ai-and-manufacturing-10-ways-ai-is-improving-manufacturing-in-2021/) - For a long time, many people feared that introducing AI into the manufacturing field would mean that they would lose their jobs. Today, after more than 60% of manufacturing companies have adopted AI technology, it is as clear as day that this is not the case – in fact, AI has even fueled the creation of new job opportunities. Some of the AI use cases are defect detection, quality assurance, predictive maintenance, inventory management, and demand prediction. Due to its immense benefits, it comes as no surprise that AI in the manufacturing market is continuously growing and is anticipated to be [worth 16.7 billion dollars by 2026.](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-manufacturing-market-72679105.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxdSHBhCdARIsAG6zhlWNS_6Dcfq04hV4DbSgbI4v_m_skoX0ZU6DFoPUPzCJwGE_q3tzS1caAm3qEALw_wcB) More information regarding the topic of AI in manufacturing can be found on the following [link](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/engineering-consulting/machine-learning-for-manufacturing/).
- [Health Care](https://www.accenture.com/t20171215T032059Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-49/Accenture-Health-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf#zoom=50) – if integrated carefully, major clinical health AI applications may potentially save the United States healthcare economy $ 150 billion on annual basis by the year 2026, according to Accenture analysis. That same analysis shows that the health AI market size is blooming, as it has grown from $ 600 million in 2014 up to $ 6.6 billion in 2021. The top AI applications within this field are Robot-Assisted Surgery, Virtual Nursing Assistants, Dosage Error Reduction, Fraud Detection, Preliminary Diagnosis, etc.
- [Retail](https://global.hitachi-solutions.com/blog/ai-in-retail) – artificial intelligence solutions in retail are assisting businesses in aligning their offers with their customer's expectations in a digital world when consumers are always demanding individualized products and services. Implementing AI within the retail business can guarantee an exciting experience, captivated customers, meaningful insights from disparate data, and synchronized offline and online retail.
- [Automotive industry](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/examples-ai-in-industry?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_508bb6b0e70045a570a45eee7eacca7d1c739a7d-1627934913-0-gqNtZGzNA6KjcnBszRf6) – self-driving technology, which was once deemed science fiction, is steadily making its way closer to becoming a reality. In fact, by 2040, it is anticipated that [over 33 million driverless vehicles](https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/self-driving-car-statistics/#:~:text=According%20to%20self%2Ddriving%20car,get%20used%20to%20driverless%20cars.) would be on the road. And once again, AI takes all the credit for bringing this futuristic technology closer to us.  
- [Procurement](https://consumergoods.com/ai-advantage-sourcing-procurement) – smart procurement is a real buzzword these days and as a matter of fact, artificial intelligence is a big part of the puzzle. In this field, AI is mostly used for solving basic, mundane, and low-rewarding tasks, which is very useful in the sense that it leaves more time for procurement professionals to focus on more complex, meaningful, and valuable. Please refer to [this](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/procurement/artificial-intelligence-in-smart-procurement/) article in case you’d like to find out more about how AI is utilized in smart procurement.

In order to integrate AI within each of the aforementioned fields, an appropriate AI software has to be created. This task belongs to the AI software companies, which create various speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning tools.

## Advantages vs Disadvantages

We have already discussed the importance of AI and its various usages and implementations in countless industries. However, the answer to the question of whether the quick-paced development of AI is going to do more good than bad to society and humanity in the long-run has been a matter of discussion for as long as AI exists – and it still remains unanswered. Let’s dive deeper into some of its [advantages and disadvantages](https://towardsdatascience.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-artificial-intelligence-182a5ef6588c) so that you can come up with the answer to the question by yourself.

So, AI can:

- **Reduce human error –** if programmed correctly, computers don’t make “human errors” such as forgetting, misunderstanding, lack of attention, poor judgment, etc. Artificial intelligence makes judgments based solely on previously acquired data and a set of algorithms. As a result, mistakes are minimized, and the prospect of achieving higher precision and accuracy is increased.
- **Take risks on behalf of humans** - by building an AI robot that can do dangerous tasks for us, we can overcome many of humanity's limitations that occur due to risk factors. It can be utilized efficiently in every type of natural or man-made disaster, as well as in exploration expeditions of the oceans and other planets, bomb disposal, mining, and many more.
- **Do the repetitive tasks** - we can use artificial intelligence to successfully automate mundane tasks such as sending generic emails or verifying documents and even eliminate “boring” jobs from humans' schedules, allowing them to be more creative. This leads to increased employers’ satisfaction and thus, higher overall productivity and efficiency.
- **Make our everyday life easier**– AI influences our decisions and affects the way we live on a daily basis. Truth is, everyone who is using a smartphone gets in touch with artificial intelligence, either through virtual assistants or the portrait mode of their camera. AI is furthermore used in the social media feed decision algorithms, ads prediction algorithms, music and media streaming services, navigation, smart home devices, surveillance, etc.

The aforementioned advantages of AI are just a small portion of the numerous capabilities of AI. However, it’s not only sunshine and butterflies - AI has its downsides as well. Let’s take a look at some of them:

- **High creation costs** - Because AI is evolving daily, hardware and software must be upgraded on a regular basis to keep up with the current requirements. The machines require repair and maintenance, and since they are very complex, this incurs significant expenses.
- **Lacking creativity and out of the box thinking** – AI can learn over time using pre-programmed facts and previous experiences, but it cannot be creative in its approach. That means that they’re only capable of doing what they have been designed to do.
- **Making humans lazy** – lots of the tasks that were previously done manually are now automated. Even though on one hand, this is very helpful in the everyday life, it can become a drawback if used excessively. If everything is done by machines, humans tend to become less focused, less motivated and lazier.

## Summary

As we have stated previously, the question of whether AI is “good” or “bad” is yet unanswered, and that’s mostly because its answer is rather subjective and depends on personal experience. However, no matter the opinions of people, it is an inevitable fact that that artificial intelligence has been in the spotlight for quite some time and as it seems, it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. This prosperous technology seems to be having a promising future ahead, and as a quick explanation of why this is to be the case, we can take a look at a [PwC study](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/industry/ai-in-industries.html) which predicts that AI can contribute up to $ 15.7 trillion dollars to the global economy in 2030.

After all we've said, it's fair to assume that AI will have more and more influence over our lives as the years go by, and how will this impact our everyday life and the society as a whole it yet to be seen.
