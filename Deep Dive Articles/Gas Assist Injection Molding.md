# Gas Assist Injection Molding

## Introduction

Gas Assisted Injection Molding is a low-pressure injection molding technique that fills an injection mold under pressure with both plastic and a gas (typically nitrogen). Gas assist molding enhances the adaptability of traditional plastic processing while benefiting from its proven repeatability in high-quality component production by offering design and manufacturing choices for a wide range of applications. Some of the main benefits of this process are the improved quality and reduced weight of the product, as well as shorter cycle times and lower overall production costs. In this article, we will focus on the gas assist injection molding technique and cover all important information one should be aware of, such as the process’ steps, its properties, advantages, and classification of the parts produced.

## Gas Assist Injection Molding Process

There exist multiple distinct types of injection molding, one of which is [gas-assisted injection molding](https://www.medicaldesignbriefs.com/component/content/article/mdb/features/articles/28361). The injection of molten plastic into the mold is aided by the introduction of pressurized nitrogen gas. The gas creates a bubble, which forces the plastic towards the mold's edges, creating hollow parts as the bubble expands. Gas assist molding has a number of process and design elements that might help satisfy specific application needs.

[The steps of this process](http://gaetanmabille.free.fr/process/Gas%20assist%20injection%20molding%20-%20GE%20plastics.pdf) are relatively similar to those of the conventional injection molding, with the difference being in the few additional gas injection stages. Let us take a closer look:

1. Mold Clamping – this is the initial step in the process and it is very important since it prevents the injected material to spill out. The injection machine places the two halves of the mold into the clamping unit which is responsible for putting and keeping the mold together against the pressure of the resin.
2. Resin Injection - the plastic, which is normally in the form of pellets, is then poured into a container where it is melted down to a liquid state. This liquid is then pumped into the mold, keeping the temperature constant throughout the process.
3. Primary Gas Penetration - a bubble is formed when gas is injected into the molten core. This bubble forces the molten into the empty cavity, thus achieving complete mold filling.
4. Secondary gas penetration - when the polymer reaches the end of the mold at the completion of the filling step, secondary gas penetration occurs. As the component cools and the material shrinks, the gas bubble expands and takes up the excess cavity volume. This pressure in the bubble also aids the packing stage of the process.
5. Gas Release - the pressure is discharged after the gassing phase, either by releasing the gas into the atmosphere or by gas recycling.
6. Part Ejection - when ambient pressure is attained and the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold should be opened and the component should be ejected.

### Gas Injection Location

The location along the melt stream where the gas is supplied varies amongst gas assist systems. Let’s take a look at the different places where gas might be injected:

- Machine Nozzle - "through-nozzle" gas assist molding is when gas is injected through a specific shut-off nozzle mounted to the press's barrel. Because the gas comes from a single place, all gas lines must be linked to the sprue or gate. Sprue is the vertical channel through which the material enters the mold and it is oftentimes used for regulating the flow of molten plastic into the mold.
- Resin Delivery System - "in-runner" gas assist molding occurs when gas is supplied into the runner system or the sprue bushing through gas pins. The gas channels must all come from the sprue if the component is direct-sprue gated.
- Mold Cavity Gas Injection System - "in-article" gas aid molding occurs when gas is supplied directly into the mold cavity using gas pins. Independent gas channels may be designed into parts molded using this technology, where each channel can have its own control over gas pressure and timing.

## Properties of Gas Assist injection molding

The gas assist technology allows for various parts with complex designs and differing wall thicknesses to be easily molded as a single part. This technique can be furthermore split into two separate sub-types: [external and internal gas assist molding](https://www.universalplastics.com/gas-assist-injection-molding/). The main difference between the two is the location where the pressurized nitrogen gas is injected.

In internal gas assist plastic molding, the gas is injected directly into the component’s cavity. The nitrogen gas is directed through strategically designed gas channels to displace the material in the thick parts of the component, resulting in hollow sections. Due to the nitrogen gas pressure, the molten resin is pushed against the cavity walls until it hardens, and the continuous, properly distributed gas pressure prevents the component from shrinking while eliminating surface blemishes, sink marks, and internal stress. Internal molding is perfect for maintaining precise measurements and intricate curvatures across long distances.

In external gas assist plastic molding, the gas is injected in a micro thin layer between the mold core and the back surface of the component. The pressurized gas ensures that the front side of the component exactly matches the mold surface when the resin cools. This process is ideal for items with a high profile and a big surface area that require exceptional surface aesthetics.

## Advantages of Gas Assist Injection Molding vs. Traditional Plastic Injection Molding

With traditional injection molding, packing pressure is applied by forcing more molten through the feed gates of the material. Due to this, the internal pressure is significantly increased and the packing pressure can only be applied as long as the material gates don’t freeze off. The gate freeze-off happens when the gate cools down and thus prevents the molten plastic from flowing through it into the mold cavity. The time it takes to reach this stage is known as 'freeze time'. As pressure continues to be applied, cooling down is also occurring in the part itself. The areas of the component farthest from the gates will freeze(solidify) first, and pressure will no longer be able to be applied to them; nevertheless, as packing pressure is applied, more resin is driven into the region closest to the gates Because of the pressure difference, the resin densities in the portion are unequal. As the part cools, it shrinks at varying speeds, generating tension and warping. This is the main problem of traditional injection molding that can be solved by introducing gas pressure, which drastically reduces the internal cavity pressure. Some other important [advantages of the gas assist injection molding](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/processes/Injection_Moulded_Gas_Assisted.aspx) are:

- Enhanced Surface Definition - gas assist injection molding produces significantly smoother surfaces, making it easier to obtain the required design. With very few alterations or subsequent operations, the plastic product can be ready for market distribution as soon as it has been ejected from the machine.
- Improved Quality – the gas-assisted technique aids the minimization of traditional injection molding defects, such as flow lines, discoloration, distortion, and warping. Thus, this method results in better dimensional control and improved quality of the produced part.
- Cost Reduction - not needing to pack the material, and the resulting hollow core in thicker components can save up to 30% on the material utilized. This directly translates to a reduction in production costs.
- Weight Reduction – the components that have been produced with gas assist injection molding are much lighter in weight when compared to those produced with conventional injection molding. The major reason for this is that [the procedure uses less space and material](https://richfieldsplastics.com/blog/advantages-of-gas-assist-injection-molding/), resulting in a more robust and sturdier product that isn't too heavy.
- Cycle Time Reduction – since there is no molten core to solidify, the material in the mold cavity hardens faster, hence the component may be ejected sooner.

## Types of Gas Assist Injection Molded Plastic Parts

Based on the molded items’ properties, they can be split into two distinct groups – contained-channel and open-channel. However, there might be parts that are a mixture of these two types.

### Contained Channel Parts

Tubes, armrests, handles, and frames are examples of contained-channel components. These items are made out of a single thick section or channel that the gas must pass through. The components are often easier to process due to the fact that the gas has a well-defined channel through which it propagates and there are no thin-walled sections that must stay gas-free.

### Open Channel Parts

Access covers, panels, shelves, and chassis are a few examples of open-channel items. The main characteristic of all items produced with this technique is that the components have a nominally thin wall with gas channels running through them. Because the gas can migrate into the thin-walled portions of the component (known as fingering), these parts are more challenging to design and produce.

## Conclusion

Gas assist injection molding is a very useful subset of plastic injection molding that uses pressurized nitrogen gas to produce cosmetically and functionally superior molded components. In general, this technique is used for the prevention of surface blemishes, sink marks, and internal stress on the molded components, which can be furthermore split into two sub-types: contained channel and open channel. The stages in the gas assist plastic injection molding are quite similar to those in traditional injection molding, except for the gas penetration and gas release steps. The two types of gas assist molding, external and internal, differ in the location where the gas is injected and thus have significantly different applications. All in all, the gas assist injection molding technology has various advantages for both producers and end-users, such as cost, weight, and cycle time reduction, as well as enhanced surface definition and improved quality. In order to decide on whether gas assist injection molding is ideal for your specific application, various factors should be considered, like production and procurement costs, components required, and material quality.
