# What is an Emergency Purchase Ratio, and Why Is It Important?

The emergency purchase ratio (EPR) is a [key performance indicator (KPI)](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/procurement-kpis/) that focuses on unplanned purchases that are placed to prevent any goods shortages. Despite every company having to make impromptu purchase orders once in a while, making a high number of such requests indicates an inadequate procurement strategy. 

Reducing the emergency purchase ratio metric is extremely important since it enhances a company’s ability to save costs, better procurement tactics, minimize supply risk, and guarantee product continuity. 

Below, we’ll explore the role of EPR in procurement planning, the emergency purchase ratio formula, emergency purchase ratio examples, the benefits of improving your emergency purchase ratio, and how organizations can reduce their EPRs. In addition to this delivery metric, we’ll also provide a brief overview of other useful procurement KPIs that, when used correctly, aid a company’s performance and success. 

## The Role of the Emergency Purchase Ratio in Business  

The emergency purchase ratio is a useful KPI in many industries, including finance, healthcare, construction, and the food industries to name a few. This metric assesses the efficiency of a business by computing the ratio of its emergency purchases to its overall number of purchases during a specified time. 

This indicator demonstrates the effectiveness of the business’s procurement planning and whether future strategies need to be modified. Consequently, it can serve as a roadmap for developing new procurement strategies. 

Having a lower value of the emergency purchase ratio directly translates to lower supply risks, lower expenses, and higher overall efficiency of the company. Therefore, the goal is to always keep this metric as low as possible. Various strategies exist that can be used in order to achieve optimal EPR, including better overall planning, employment of reward mechanisms, improved supplier evaluation, and better staff training.

## Emergency Purchase Ratio Formula

The emergency purchase ratio is measured by dividing an organization’s emergency purchases by the total number of purchases made over a defined period of time. Put into simpler words, this ratio is computed by simply determining what proportion of the purchases that were made were emergency purchases. 

This is the formula for calculating the ERP:

<p align="center">**Emergency Purchase Ratio** = *Number of Emergency Purchases* / *Total Number of Purchases*</p>


## Emergency Purchase Ratio Examples

Emergency purchases might be deemed necessary to preserve lives, protect the public’s health and safety, and protect property in case of natural disasters like fires, explosions, and adverse weather conditions. 

Let us take a very recent happening as an example ー the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/manufacturer-response-to-covid-19-disruptions-increased-interest-in-automation-reshoring/). Due to the severity of the situation, a huge number of emergency purchases were made on a global level during this period, such as masks, sanitation stations, and proper safety equipment for medical practitioners.

Another possible scenario would be a huge [fire](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/will-your-home-survive-a-firestorm/) that is spreading quickly and poses a threat to the lives of many people. In situations like this, the government is forced to [react immediately](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/emergency-response-checklist/) and emergency purchases of different supplies such as extinguishers, first aid kits, or firefighting vehicles must be made, following the regulations, policies, and procedures of the country in question. In this case, as well as the one mentioned above, the emergency purchase ratios for the year or period of time when the incident happened would be very high.

A third example, this time concerning the IT industry, would be when a server that supports a jail’s security system malfunctions, the facility is forced to use its backup server. To maintain the security of both the prison’s inmates and the general public, the server has to be replaced right away.

## What Are the Benefits of Improving an Emergency Purchase Ratio?

Some of the most important benefits of improving the emergency purchase ratio include lower supply chain risks, cost reduction, better procurement strategies, and guaranteed continuity of goods.

Keeping the emergency purchase ratio value as low as possible helps in maintaining great procurement performance and preventing supply chain bottlenecks, product portfolio shortages, and additional costs like faster freight. Since no procurement KPI can be observed as completely independent from the others, improving all KPIs in general leads to improved team management, improved resource allocation, improved productivity and performance, and increased impact of strategic sourcing on business. 

Let’s take a closer look at each of these advantages:

### Lower Supply Chain Risk

The possibility of an incident involving inbound supplies from individual supplier failures or the supply market occurring inside the supply chain and disrupting the flow of goods, whether raw materials or parts, is known as a [supply chain risk](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/expert-shares-3-major-supply-chain-risks-to-avoid/). When making an emergency purchase, there is a higher-than-usual possibility of something going wrong ー either the supplier not being able to complete the order or there simply being uncalculated global bottlenecks. Therefore, reducing the emergency purchase ratio helps in better utilizing the supply chain analytics and possibly avoiding disruptions.

### Cost Reduction

In procurement, cost reduction refers to the practice of cutting unneeded direct and indirect costs to increase revenue and profit margin by performing ongoing cost analysis, corrective measures, and financial planning. 

Cost-cutting boosts profitability, but only if sales volumes and pricing are the same. If cost savings lead to a decline in the quality of its products, a reduction in prices might be necessary, which would ultimately lead to similar, maybe even lower profits. 

The problem with emergency purchases is that the procurement team can barely make use of the thoroughly analyzed trends and current state of the market due to the pressure and urgency of the task. Moreover, because of the very short timeframe, the cost of the purchase order might be a lot higher than usual, leading to decreased cost-effectiveness. Having a lower emergency purchase ratio therefore greatly helps with improving the company’s cost savings.

### Better Procurement Strategies

The [procurement strategy](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/6-key-improvements-to-streamline-procurement-strategy/), also known as a procurement plan, is a long-term plan to affordably get the required supplies from a list of successful suppliers who will deliver high-quality items on schedule while adhering to the purchase conditions. It is a consistent source of added value for the business, and it ensures its overall performance. 

Most often, the procurement department comes up with several distinct procurement strategies regarding critical topics such as cost reduction, quality control, and risk reduction. 

Two procurement challenges that might cause a problem in the defined strategies are risk mitigation and dark purchasing. Risk mitigation refers to the supply risk, be it fraud, quality, or cost, while dark purchasing takes into account all purchases that were made outside a defined procurement process. Since emergency purchases fall under dark purchasing and directly affect supply risk management, reducing the EPR helps in creating and maintaining better and more reliable strategies.

### Continuity of Goods

The main purpose of the continuity of goods is to ensure an uninterrupted flow of goods and services from suppliers to consumers within a reasonable level and time period to protect the organization’s and interested parties’ most important operations. It is also referred to as continuity of supply, and it is managed with the help of supply chain continuity management. 

Once again, an emergency purchase would disrupt the supply chain and possibly disrupt the entire continuity of the goods, causing significant problems for the company. Therefore, maintaining lower EPR will ensure higher levels of stable supply continuity and a lower purchase order cycle time.

## How Can Organizations Reduce Emergency Purchase Ratios?

Different methodologies and strategies may be employed to reduce the emergency purchase ratio within a company, such as better planning, utilization of reward mechanisms, better evaluation of suppliers, and better staff training. In the previous section, we underlined the main benefits of optimizing this metric and why doing so aids the overall performance of the company and creates a competitive advantage. 

A company should always strive to reduce the number of emergency purchases that are being made ー and since there may be various reasons as to why this ratio might not be optimal, there exist several different approaches to solving this issue, which do not mutually exclude each other. These include the following:

### Inventory Control and Planning

There should be consistent and thorough communication between the various departments of the company and the procurement department so all teams are informed in case any new materials will be needed in the near future. Being constantly up-to-date with the needs and inventory status of the departments allows the procurement teams to better plan the whole process and thus ensure cost avoidance. 

### Staff Training

Any team, from any sector, requires ongoing training and capacity building to function effectively ー the procurement department is no exception. Training focuses on enhancing employees’ abilities and expertise, keeping them informed about new procedures and processes in a particular area of the business, and even keeping them in line with the organization’s aims and objectives. 

The best method to achieve peak team performance is through a detailed, extensive training program. Another way to increase the performance of the procurement team is by employing reward strategies, meaning they get awarded for achieving specific goals, like keeping the EPR as low as possible.

### Better Evaluation of Suppliers

[Suppliers](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/6-secrets-to-successful-procurement-in-a-crisis/) play a crucial role in the operation of the company and affect costs, product quality, and delivery time. Therefore, when choosing suppliers, the procurement manager should look for references, ask for feedback from other clients, and confirm that the supplier is in line with the company’s values and objectives. 

Some of the metrics that may be used to determine supplier performance are supplier defect rate, supplier lead time, and supplier availability. 

Apart from making strong connections with reliable, long-term suppliers, the procurement team should always come up with a long list of alternative suppliers, just to make sure they have good options even in times of crisis. That’s because having too few suppliers on the list might cause problems in times when emergency purchasing is needed since the contracted suppliers might not be able to act as urgently as needed. Having a larger number of suppliers that would serve as backup is absolutely necessary.

Related Procurement KPIs and Metrics
------------------------------------

Procurement KPIs, also known as procurement metrics, are tools with which a company’s procurement management efficiency is monitored and evaluated. Organizations may simplify and optimize their time, service quality, expenditure, and cost with the use of these KPIs. Additionally, procurement KPIs assist businesses in staying on track with their overall procurement strategy, goals, and business objectives. 

Procurement KPIs paint a picture of the present performance level and aid in determining if the business is where it needs to be. They simplify organizational performance into a set of straightforward and useful measurements, which enhance decision-making and help to lessen its complexity.

[Procurement KPIs](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/procurement-kpis/) can be categorized into a number of groups depending on their purpose and usage, including quality, inventory management, delivery, and cost-saving KPIs. With regard to this grouping, it is important to note that the emergency purchase ratio falls into the class of delivery metrics. The fact that none of these metrics categories operate in a vacuum, however, should always be kept in mind because concentrating only on one of them might have a negative impact on the others. To achieve all of the advantages that procurement management has to offer, there has to be a careful balancing act.

Every procurement team should, without fail, track the following EPR-related procurement KPIs:

### Procurement ROI and Benefits

The procurement’s return on investment (ROI) is used for measuring the cost-effectiveness and profitability of the money spent on running a procurement function. The metric falls under the category of cost-saving KPIs and is best used for internal analysis. One way of calculating the ROI is by dividing the annual cost savings by the annual procurement costs.

### Compliance Rate

The compliance rate is a quality KPI that aids in evaluating supplier adherence to requirements. The fundamental contract between the supplier and the business serves as the foundation for the whole procurement process. The parameters of this agreement include payment methods, delivery dates, special discounts, and a maximum response time in the event of problems or delays. Indirect procurement or maverick expenditure rises as the compliance rate KPI declines. 

By negotiating with suppliers, the compliance rate KPI helps reduce costs and offers insights into the [relationships with suppliers](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/the-key-to-a-durable-supplier-relationship-is-partnership/). Two main metrics that influence this KPI are the percentage of disputed bills to total invoices for that supplier and the gap between the price paid and the price stated.

### Supplier Defect Rate

The supplier defect rate KPI is another quality KPI that is helpful in assessing the provider’s quality. The procurement department may use this KPI to assess the product’s final quality in great detail. The number of substandard products to the total number of units tested is used to calculate this statistic. 

The defect rate of a supplier is often expressed in terms of faults per million. To acquire useful insights into vendor performance, the procurement department might calculate the supplier defect rate and segment it based on the defect type.

### Inventory Aging

An inventory aging report is a list of all the things on hand that is arranged according to how long they have been in stock. As expected, this KPI belongs to the class of inventory KPIs, together with inventory turnover ratio and inventory carrying costs. This statistic is employed to assess whether inventory is slow-moving and to calculate the expenses of preserving and holding these items prior to sale.

### Supplier Lead Time

This delivery KPI shows how long it takes for an order to be shipped from the time the supplier gets it. The length of the supplier lead times, which are commonly expressed in days, begins with the order and availability confirmation and concludes with delivery. 

Buyers are responsible for establishing expectations for lead times and checking that suppliers adhere to them. Corrective action is necessary if the intended lead time is often missed. Small lead times are desirable, provided that the quality is not compromised.

Cost Savings Occurs Across Departments 
---------------------------------------

The emergency purchase ratio is a delivery KPI that reflects the efficiency of a business’s procurement strategy. This metric should be as low as possible since a lower ratio directly translates to improved procurement function, reduced supply risk, better operational continuity, and reduction of costs.  

In order to keep the emergency purchase ratio at an optimal level, constant efforts have to be made towards better overall planning, better evaluation of the partnering suppliers, and better training of the employees from all departments, not just the procurement teams.
