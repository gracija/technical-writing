# How is Plastic Made – A Step-by-Step Explanation

_How is plastic made?_

If this question has awakened your curiosity, keep on reading – this article tackles the whole plastic-making process, following a detailed explanation of all of its phases.

In the 1950s, [about 2 million tons of plastics were produced per year](https://recyclecoach.com/resources/7-revealing-plastic-waste-statistics-2021/). This number has increased 200 times by 2015, and by 2021, there are approximately 8.3 billion tons of plastics in the world. Due to its v**ersatility, ease of manufacture, and low cost, this material’s usage ranges from single-use glasses to household furniture, car parts, and** aircraft and communications equipment.

_But first of all…_

## What is Plastic?

[Plastic](https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic) is a synthetic or naturally occurring polymer that, due to its structure, can be easily molded and shaped under heat and pressure. This property is known as plasticity, hence the name of this material comes as no surprise. Moreover, plastic is chemically stable, lightweight, water and shock-resistant, has low thermal conductivity, and has good insulation.

[Polymers](https://www.britannica.com/science/polymer), by definition, are big molecules formed by chemically connecting a series of simpler units called monomers, thus creating a chain-like structure. These substances, apart from serving as the foundation for plastic, are the principal constituent of many other materials such as glass, paper, and rubber. Moreover, polymers are the basis of many minerals - diamond, quartz, and feldspar, as well as many components in living organisms, like proteins, cellulose, and nucleic acids. Depending on the purpose, polymers can have numerous [properties](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-polymer-820536), such as reflectivity, impact resistance, brittleness, translucence, ductility, and elasticity.

Most commonly, [plastic is categorized into two distinct groups](https://www.thoughtco.com/plastic-chemical-composition-608930); thermoplastics and thermosets. There exist several major [differences between the two groups](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/thermoset-vs-thermoplastics/?_ga=2.99778846.1625679902.1642019401-363782390.1641506590), with the main one being that thermoplastics can be heated and reshaped repeatedly, while thermosets harden into a permanent shape when exposed to heat. Moreover, the molecular weight of thermoplastics ranges from 20,000 to 500,000 AMU (atomic mass unit), while thermosets are considered to have infinite molecular weight.

## What is Plastic Made of?

The majority of plastic in use today is made from [hydrocarbons](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/how-is-plastic-made.aspx) – organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen. These hydrocarbons are derived from materials of biological origin occurring within Earth’s crust, known as [fossil fuels](https://www.britannica.com/science/fossil-fuel). These fossil fuels, which can be used as a source of energy, are created from the petrified, buried remains of plants and animals that existed millions of years ago. Some examples of fossil fuels are:

- [Crude oil](https://www.britannica.com/science/crude-oil) – also known as liquid petroleum. It can be found in oil sands (tar sands), underground reservoirs, and in the gaps and pores of sedimentary rocks. It can be obtained by drilling on land or at sea, or by strip mining.
- [Natural gas](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-gas) – also known as methane gas. Depending on where it's located underground, natural gas is classified as either conventional or unconventional. The conventional one can be found in permeable bedrocks or blended into oil reservoirs and can be extracted using ordinary drilling techniques. On the other hand, unconventional natural gas extraction requires special techniques such as fracking, since the regular drilling technique can be too costly and difficult.
- [Coal](https://www.britannica.com/science/coal-fossil-fuel) - it is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel we can burn in terms of emissions. Coal is a solid, carbon-rich rock that is classified into four types based on its carbon content: lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, and anthracite. Coal extraction is done by either underground mining, which utilizes machines to mine coal from deep underground seams, or surface mining, which scrapes layers of soil to get to the coal deposits.

It is important to note that plastic can be made from other, more eco-friendly sources that replace fossil fuels. This plastic, known as [renewable plastic](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/benefits-biodegradable-plastic-79207.html) or bioplastic, is created from renewable biomass such as terpenes, lignin, cellulose, vegetable fat, bacteria, wood fibers, carbohydrates, recycled food waste, etc. Biodegradable plastic doesn’t contain the potentially dangerous chemical BPA and is likely to dissolve in a couple of months. In addition, over its lifetime, bioplastic emits much less greenhouse gas compared to ordinary plastic.

## How is Plastic Made

This section will cover everything you need to know about the entire plastic-making process, starting from raw material extraction up to its fabrication.

1. **Extraction of raw** **materials** – as mentioned above, the vast majority of the plastic that is being produced is made of fossil fuels. Therefore, extracting crude oil, natural gas, and sometimes coal from the ground is the first step of the process. The different techniques that are used for the extraction of the materials are covered in the previous section.
2. **Refinement** – the fossil fuels are sent to refineries where they are converted into different petroleum products, such as gasoline, asphalt, jet fuel, waxes, and lubricating oils. Here’s where the building blocks of plastic, ethane and propane, are created as well.

_How does this work?_

Crude oil is heated in a furnace before being vaporized and delivered to a fractional distillation tower. The distillation tower has a temperature gradient, with the top being colder than the bottom. Based on their boiling point (the temperature at which the phase shift from liquid to gas happens) and weight, the liquids and gasses in the tower get segregated. The vapors of the lighter fractions, such as gasoline and petroleum gas, drift to the top of the tower, while the heavier ones, such as residual fuel oil, remain at the bottom. All of these fractions in the tower contain hydrocarbons with a comparable amount of carbon atoms, with smaller molecules being towards the top. Natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, as well as naphtha are the most important feedstock for the production of plastic. However, to be useful, these hydrocarbons need to be sent to a cracker plant and undergo a procedure named cracking.

1. **Cracking –** by utilizing high temperature, pressure, and sometimes catalysts, the complicated hydrocarbons are broken down into simpler, low molecular mass alkenes/alkanes. This process is important because it transforms the abovementioned ethane into ethylene, as well as propane into propylene.

_There exist two types of cracking: steam cracking and catalytic cracking_

The [steam cracking](https://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/processes/cracking-isomerisation-and-reforming.html) process is carried out in steam crackers, which are extremely complex and energy-intensive facilities. Here, the chemicals are first mixed with steam and then heated to 1430-1610 Fahrenheit degrees inside a tubular reactor. In order to prevent the feedstock from forming carbon, which might happen at such temperatures, it is being sent through the furnace’s pipes very fast and at very low pressure. The stream here plays two roles; first, it prevents carbonization, and second, it prevents possible leaks that might result in air entering the feedstock thus creating an explosive mixture. In the end, the cracked feedstock is rapidly cooled using a succession of techniques like compression, absorption, drying, refrigeration, fractionation, and selective hydrogenation.

&nbsp;

The [catalytic cracking](https://fqechemicals.com/catalytic-cracking/) process does not require such high temperatures or pressure due to the presence of the catalyst. First, in the reaction phase, the feedstock is contacted by a catalyst at temperatures of approximately 900 Fahrenheit degrees, and the cracking reaction occurs. The product proportions are determined by the temperature, the residence time, and the catalyst. In the regeneration phase, the catalyst is removed from the products, regenerated in the air by burning off accumulated carbon, and then recycled. In the end, fractionating equipment is used in order to separate the cracked hydrocarbons – a procedure known as fractionation.

After their forming, ethylene, and propylene are monomers and thus need to be processed still further.

1. [Polymerization](https://www.britannica.com/science/polymerization) – in this step, the monomers are linked together by a chemical reaction in order to form polymers. This can be achieved by either addition, which results in all of the monomer's atoms being present in the polymer, or by condensation, which results in the formation of a tiny molecule byproduct.

&nbsp;

Let’s take a closer look at both [polymerization techniques](https://science.jrank.org/pages/5405/Polymer.html):

&nbsp;

- - Addition polymerization – the monomers are simply ‘added’ together and no atoms are lost or gained throughout this process. Monomers with double bonds are the simplest chemical structure by which polymerization may occur. Heat and pressure, UV light, or another more reactive chemical such as peroxide can all be used to initiate the polymerization process. As a reaction, the double bond breaks and releases highly reactive unpaired electrons known as free radicals. The polymer chain starts to form when these radicals react with other radicals or with other double bonds. Polyethylene, polypropylene, Teflon, Lucite, and rubber are examples of addition polymers.

&nbsp;

- - Condensation polymerization – most of the natural polymers are formed by condensation polymerization. This type of polymerization is more complex than the previous one. Apart from polymers, this reaction results in another small molecule being formed. This small molecule, known as a byproduct, is often water and in that case, it gets disposed of easily. Sometimes, byproducts can be raw materials that are recycled into feedstock. Some examples of condensation polymers include nylon, Dacron, and Formica.

After this step, ethylene is transformed into polyethylene, while propylene - into polypropylene.

Polyethylene is the most commonly used plastic in the world. It is highly ductile and resistant; usages range from gas and water pipe networks to insulation for data cables.

Polypropylene is even harder than polyethylene and is more heat-resistant. It can be found in car parts and medical syringes.

&nbsp;

1. [**Fabrication**](https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic/The-processing-and-fabrication-of-plastics) – this is the last step in which the plastic gets its final form. In order to make it easier to transport, the [resins](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/types-of-resins/) are most frequently further processed into pellets. These pellets are then reshaped into various plastic products. There exist various plastic fabrication methods, and some of the most commonly used are:

- Extrusion – melted polymer is squeezed through an opening with a certain cross-section (the die) to form a continuous shape with a cross-section that is comparable to that of the aperture. Extrusion may generate a variety of items, including film, sheet, tubing, pipes, insulation, and house siding. The profile is specified by the die geometry in each case, and solidification is accomplished by cooling. More information can be found in our guide on [plastic extrusion](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/the-plastic-extrusion-process/?_ga=2.263747980.1257237186.1641506590-363782390.1641506590).
- Molding – liquid plastic is poured into a certain container or mold and thus it solidifies into a specific form. There exist different types of molding: injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding, reaction injection molding, compression molding, and [bag molding](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/custom-manufacturing-fabricating/bag-molding-process/?_ga=2.258543626.1257237186.1641506590-363782390.1641506590).

- [Welding](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/custom-manufacturing-fabricating/plastic-welding/?_ga=2.28016956.1625679902.1642019401-363782390.1641506590) – two or more workpieces are joined together by melting them with high heat. Welding can be done in a variety of ways, including hot gas emissions, high-frequency vibration, spinning, and contact welding. Plastic welding equipment varies depending on the method and kind of plastic used.
