# What is Polymaker PC-PBT?

PC-PBT is a stiff polymer blend made up of two other polymer materials – polycarbonate and polybutylene terephthalate. PC-PBT can be produced in many different forms, one of which is as a 3D printing filament, and Polymaker is simply a company that manufactures this material in such form. It has a density of 1.17 - 1.24 g/cm³, a melting point of 223˚C, and a glass transition temperature of 140˚C. Moreover, this polymer alloy has great impact resistance, heat resistance, and chemical resistance. Due to its properties, PC-PBT has been used primarily in the automotive, manufacturing, and water supply industries for the production of various products such as: body panels, door handles, wiring equipment, irrigation components, and garden power tools.

In this article, we'll be covering all the basics around the PC-PBT polymer blend, including: what is Polymaker PC-PBT, how is Polymaker PC-PBT made, what are the characteristics of Polymaker PC-PBT, what are the uses of Polymaker PC-PBT, what are the advantages of Polymaker PC-PBT, what are the disadvantages of Polymaker PC-PBT, how does Polymaker PC-PBT affect human health, and is Polymaker PC-PBT toxic.

## What Is Polymaker PC-PBT?

PC-PBT is a versatile, heat-resistant thermoplastic blend of two other thermoplastics - polycarbonate (PC) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), while Polymaker is one specific manufacturer that supplies this material in 3D printer filament form. However, it’s worth noting that this material is also made by other companies and used in other production methods. By definition, polymer blends are physical blends of structurally distinct homopolymers or copolymers. Polymer blends (polymer alloys) are produced by combining two or more polymers to create a new material with an enhanced set of properties. Polycarbonate, one of the two polymers that compose the PC-PBT filament is a naturally transparent amorphous thermoplastic used mostly for tougher materials. The other component, polybutylene terephthalate, is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer that belongs to the polyester family of polymers. The stiffness, high strength, and resistance to thermal deformation of this material, together with polycarbonate’s dimensional stability and impact strength, create the durable, chemically resistant polymer blend PC-PBT. The majority of commercial PC–PBT mixes include around a 50/50 weight percentage of PC and PBT.

## How Is Polymaker PC-PBT Made?

PC-PBT is made by mixing polycarbonate and polybutylene terephthalate together. In general, the main reason behind making polymer blends is to get a material that would have a combined set of properties by only taking a desirable subset of properties from both of the individual composing polymers. In most cases, PC-PBT is made with the help of a solvent – a usually liquid substance that is used for dissolving a solute, or PC and PBT in this case. As soon as the solvent evaporates, the two polymers will be completely blended together, creating the PC-PBT alloy.

## What Are the Characteristics of Polymaker PC-PBT?

The PC-PBT blend, regardless of its form and manufacturer, exhibits great impact resistance and chemical resistance properties. This impact resistance allows for the material to stay intact even when exposed to low temperatures, while its chemical resistance makes it inert to chemical attacks. Moreover, PC-PBT provides excellent abrasion resistance, heat resistance, excellent aesthetics, and excellent flow properties. As mentioned, this polymer blend is resistant to many chemicals, including hydrocarbons, organic acids, inorganic aqueous salts, alcohols, and mild base and acid solutions. However, PC-PBT is not resistant to strong alkalis and chlorinated aromatic solvents that include ketones or esters. Some important factors that influence the chemical resistance of the material are: the temperature to which the item is exposed, the duration of exposure, and the composition of the surrounding media. As a result, performing a preliminary resistance test in real-world settings is of the utmost importance.

## What Are the Uses of Polymaker PC-PBT?

The PC-PBT blend is commonly used in the automotive, water supply, and manufacturing industries. Injection molding is the most common method of processing this polymer. However, there are grades available for extrusion, blow molding, transfer and compression molding, solid-state processing, and thermoforming. The produced parts can be afterward painted, hot-stamped, metalized, and plated.

The PC-PBT filament is very frequently used for 3D printing of various products, such as: electronic device covers and bases, virtual reality and augmented reality headsets, gadget housings, and battery housings. Apart from being utilized as a 3D printing filament, the PC-PBT polymer has many other broader applications. For example, this material is very often used in the automotive industry for body panels that require toughness at low temperatures, heat resistance, dimensional stability, and stress-cracking resistance. Moreover, the high chemical resistance property of the PC-PBT material makes it an ideal choice for lawn and garden power tools and equipment, as well as other applications that require resistance to intermittent contact with lubricants, solvents, fuels, oils, and other chemicals. Some of the primary usages of PA 612 include:

- Vehicle bumpers
- Tailgate outer panels
- Door handles
- Door hoods
- Outdoor equipment
- Housings
- Wiring equipment

## What Are the Advantages of Polymaker PC-PBT?

The main advantages of the PC-PBT material in general, not only the filament produced by Polymaker, are its high impact strength and heat resistance. In fact, this material exhibits excellent impact resistance even at very low temperatures down to -40 ˚C. In general, this polymer blend has great chemical resistance, a property that’s directly related to the relative percentage of PBT within the blend. In other words, the higher the percentage of PBT, the higher the chemical resistance of the composite material. PC-PBT has good processability and is easy to machine, fabricate, paint, and glue. All in all, this polymer has a good balance of mechanical and chemical properties.

## What Are the Disadvantages of Polymaker PC-PBT?

One disadvantage of the PC-PBT blend is that it may experience some deterioration when exposed to intense UV light and heat for a longer period of time due to the formation of radicals. Heat stabilizers are applied to the material to quench the radicals that form during the material's melting and molding phases. Moreover, even though PC-PBT had good chemical resistance, this material is not resistant to some chlorinated solvents and strong alkalis. In fact, the chemical resistance and shrinkage are better in this polymer alloy than in polycarbonate alone, but not as good as in polybutylene terephthalate alone. Another disadvantage of the PC-PBT blend is that it is opaque. It should be noted that these disadvantages are about the PC-PBT blend in general, not only the specific filament produced by Polymaker.

## How Does Polymaker PC-PBT Affect Human Health?

The PC-PBT blend is considered relatively non-hazardous to human health in all forms as the most severe problems it causes in most cases are moderate irritations. According to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, this product is not hazardous in the form in which it is shipped by Polymaker. The signal word, which is used to describe the short-term toxicity of a product, in this case –PC-PBT, is ‘Warning’. This means that the product is moderately hazardous if indigested, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. Since this material is composed of two different thermoplastics, the safety of those materials directly impacts the PC-PBT blend’s safety as well. Polybutylene Terephthalate is classified as a non-dangerous substance according to the GHS. On the other hand, some polycarbonates are considered hazardous when they come into contact with food due to the release of Bisphenol A (also referred to as BPA) during decomposition. The majority of polycarbonates are manufactured from a mixture of BPA and COCl2, but nowadays, many polycarbonates are BPA-free and inherently - less toxic.

The most likely routes of exposure are through: skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. In case of accidental inhalation of dust or fumes from overheating or combustion, a respiratory tract irritation might happen so the person should move to fresh air as soon as possible. Moreover, accidental ingestion of PC-PBT might be hazardous and medical help should be requested if such a thing happens. A thermal burn, which is considered a more severe injury, might happen if the person’s skin comes in contact with the heated material.

### Is Polymaker PC-PBT Toxic?

In general, PC-PBT is considered a non-toxic polymer alloy. However, oftentimes, this material is mixed with carbon black in order to improve its abrasion resistance, and tensile strength, and protect it from UV degradation. Carbon black is classified as a serious health hazard, especially when inhaled since it might cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and even birth anomalies. Ingestion of carbon black is also highly dangerous and will most probably cause severe throat irritation. Nevertheless, if even added to the PC-PBT mix, this carbon is represented in very small dosages (0.1-1.0%) and because of this, we can say that PC-PBT is defined as a generally safe thermoplastic alloy. Carbon black is present in the PC-PBT filament produced by Polymaker as well, but in very small dosages of between 0.1 and 1.0%, and because of this, we can say that Polymaker PC-PBT is a generally safe thermoplastic alloy.

## Conclusion

This article covered useful general information regarding one of the commonly used thermoplastic blends – PC-PBT. This material is generally considered non-hazardous to human health, but if other materials are added to the blend, such as carbon black, it becomes a moderate irritant, and many cause even more severe reactions. The PC-PBT polymer alloy has high impact strength, heat resistance, and chemical resistance, but it might deteriorate when exposed to intense UV light for a longer period of time.
