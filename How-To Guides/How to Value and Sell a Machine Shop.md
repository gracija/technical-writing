## Overview of the Company Selling Process

[Succession planning](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/other/succession-planning-for-small-business/) is a crucial part of making sure the company will survive a potential management and ownership change, especially when it comes to smaller companies. Given that, apart from retirement, many other unexpected things may happen which may lead to such changes, having a succession plan helps in sleeping peacefully at night. The main things a person should do before writing the actual succession plan are deciding the exit strategy, finding good advisors, and valuing the business.

One of the most widely applied exit strategies is actually selling the business. Often enough, this is a hard decision for the owner to make, so once it is made, it is important to carefully go through all important steps and execute them correctly in order to have a successful sale. But what are the [steps for selling a small or medium-sized business](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/other/how-to-sell-a-small-medium-sized-business/)?

The first phase is the preparation phase, which should start long before the actual selling. The next step is making a correct valuation of the company’s worth, and this is important because both overestimating and underestimating the business leads to missing out on buyers or profit. Then, the question of whether a broker is needed should be answered, and afterward, the important documents should be prepared. The last step is to find the right buyer which is oftentimes a challenging task.

## How to Value a Manufacturing Business like a Machine Shop

Within this section, we will explore the process of valuing your machine business by utilizing [valuation multiples](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/types-of-valuation-multiples/) – financial ‘normalization’ measurement tools which help in comparing companies of different sizes and scopes. While only a qualified professional can calculate the exact worth of your business, these metrics may help you get some approximate numbers by yourself and thus get a clearer understanding of where you stand in the market.

Valuation multiples, also known as market multiples, are ratios that compare one financial statistic to another. Multiples are quite straightforward and easy to utilize, but that also makes them prone to oversimplification, so they shouldn’t be used as an exclusive source of information when making any big decisions. Moreover, they are limited to relatively short-term scenarios since they portray the current company’s situation and not its potential future status.

Three of the most popular valuation multiples are the revenue, EBITDA, and SDE multiples. These multiples are derived from numerous parameters, such as the size of the company, the market’s trends, the tangible and intangible assets of the business, and the extent to which the owner’s skills or the brand itself affects the company’s value. Calculating these multiples can be quite complicating, so it’s important to either hire a consultant, or, in case you would like to do this on your own, do your research and follow some comprehensive, up-to-date guides. More details about the factors impacting the multiples and thus the overall value can be found in the next section.

Now let’s take a look at how these multiples can be used in order to calculate the value of the business:

- [**SDE**](https://www.midstreet.com/blog/sellers-discretionary-earnings-explained-with-examples) – stands for _Seller’s Discretionary Earnings._ This metric is mostly used for small and mid-size businesses and it calculates the total financial benefit provided to one full-time owner-operator. The idea of SDE is to estimate the company’s true earnings by adding back certain expenses to the total earnings such as the officer’s salary and health insurance, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. However, in order to get the business value, this calculated SDE has to be multiplied with an SDE multiple, as the formula suggests:

<p align="center">**Business Value** = *SDE* × *SDE Multiple*</p>

According to [Peak Business Valuation](https://peakbusinessvaluation.com/valuation-multiples-for-a-machine-shop/), the average SDE Multiple ranges for a machine shop is between _2.34x_ and _3.49x_.

- [**EBITDA**](https://www.midstreet.com/blog/what-is-ebitda) – stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. This metric is mostly used for bigger businesses that have earnings over $1.5 million. Unlike SDE, which tells the buyer how much money they would make if they worked full-time in it, EBITDA helps investors to compare your company to others in the same industry by removing expenses that affect a fair comparison. The formula is, however, similar:

<p align="center">**Business Value** = *EBITDA* × *EBITDA Multiple*</p>

According to Peak Business Valuation, the average EBITDA Multiple ranges for a machine shop is between _3.04x_ and _4.23x_.

- [**Revenue**](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/revmult.pdf) – this is the least favorite metric amongst financial experts since it measures the revenue of the company, which might be a poor indicator of the company’s value. The calculation is as follows:

<p align="center">**Business Value** = *Revenue* × *Revenue Multiple*</p>

According to Peak Business Valuation, the average Revenue Multiple ranges for a machine shop is between 0.61x and 1.22x.

## Factors Impacting Machine Shop Value

As explained before, the overall value of the machine shop depends on a [wide variety of factors](https://www.midstreet.com/blog/how-to-value-and-sell-a-machine-shop), including:

- _Customer Quality_ – customers in emerging industries are seen more positively in the long run than those in mature or declining industries, and long-standing connections with acclaimed clients will positively impact the company's value. A diverse customer base (many different consumers, none with a disproportionately significant share of overall sales) is also advantageous.
- _Owner Involvement_ – if the owner’s involvement is too high and the company is dependent on him, the buyer would need to find a replacement for this person, which can be complicated and time-consuming. In other words, the easier it is to replace the seller’s job responsibilities, the greater the multiple the business can reach and the easier it will be to sell.
- _Employees’ Quality_ – employees have always been the most important asset to a company. The skills, experience, and years spent in the machine shop, as well as the certifications these mechanists, programmers, inspectors, and tool room managers, have all play a vital role in how the business will be evaluated.
- _Technology_ - The condition of the machinery and the level of technology can have a major impact on the price of the machine shop. Even though having newer equipment is an advantage, what matters more is how these machines are being utilized. Investing in state-of-the-art machinery is a good idea, but only when it is affordable and improves efficiency. The most important thing is to make sure that any equipment that needs to be fixed or replaced is taken care of before attempting to sell the machine shop.

- _Certifications_ - Certifications are becoming an increasingly essential consideration for strategic buyers looking to purchase a machine shop, and they can be a great tool for establishing trust by demonstrating that your service matches your clients' expectations. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides certification that ensures quality, safety, and efficiency by providing world-class specifications for products, services, and systems. Quality certifications, such as ISO 9000, can be extremely beneficial to the business.

## Potential Machine Shop Buyers

After understanding what factors influence the value of your machine shop and correspondingly setting a reasonable price, the next step, and probably the most difficult one, is finding the right buyer. There are many potential ‘buyers’ who will only waste your time - either because they don’t have the money, or because they are solely interested in receiving insider information such as the current market trends and prices.

Essentially, the buyers can be split into three distinct groups:

1. Individuals – most frequently, the businesses in the lower-middle market across all industries are purchased by a single person. That’s why the majority of machine shops will be acquired by an individual – however, this is not the case for larger machine companies since not many buyers will be able to afford it.
2. Strategic Buyers – this buyer is actually another company that might gain a strategic benefit from purchasing your business. For example, a strategic buyer would buy a machine shop in order to provide a wider selection of services and products, or maybe bring the manufacturing of their components in-house. This type of buyer is mostly willing to pay a bigger price, but they also know how to get a good bargain since they’ve most probably bought and sold businesses before.
3. Private Equity – this type of buyer gets money from private investors, buys the company using this money, then grows and sells the company for a bigger price, and provides a return to the investors.

## Do you Need to Hire a Broker?

Hiring a broker certainly has its benefits – they know the right people and have the needed experience and knowledge. Essentially, they do their job and thus you have enough time to do your – run the company while it’s still yours. Nevertheless, hiring the wrong broker might do more bad than good – paying lots of money for unskilled broker who will prolong the selling process for a year or so is definitely no fun.

Let’s take a look at the [advantages and disadvantages of hiring a broker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardparker/2016/09/08/a-big-decision-when-selling-a-business-do-it-yourself-or-hire-a-broker/?sh=50bf079665ad) into more detail. First - the pros:

1. They have connections to numerous potential qualified buyers, investors, and banks.
2. They specialize in selling businesses; they understand the procedure and the documentation required, and they know how to assess a company's strong and weak points.
3. You can focus on running your business while they focus on selling it. A popular statistic cited in the business brokerage sector is that the average small company for sale will sell in nine months, so it’s important to continue managing your business throughout that time.

As mentioned above, there exist some noteworthy drawbacks as well:

1. They are expensive –the commission varies between six and twelve percent. However, in most cases, a ten percent fee is charged based on the total transactional value.
2. It can be hard to find a good broker. Everyone is capable of placing an ad in the local newspaper or online – the tricky part is understanding the industry, having the right contacts, and being a negotiation expert. Finding the person with the needed skills might be difficult, and the best indicator is a reference from a reputable source such as an attorney, accountant, or even better, another business owner who has utilized their services.
3. They require an exclusive contract which, most of the time, has a timeframe of one year, and in case you run into a bad broker, that might mean a one-year stagnation of the selling process. It’s best to try and negotiate a shorter engagement period of six, or even three months.
