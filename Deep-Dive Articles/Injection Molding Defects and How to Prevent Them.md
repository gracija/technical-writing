# Injection Molding Defects and How to Prevent Them

[Injection molding](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-injection-moulding) is a manufacturing technique that enables fast and large-scale production of components used in a large variety of industries. The most frequently used materials for this traditional manufacturing process are thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Principally, plastic injection molding works by melting plastic pellets and injecting them at high pressure into a mold cavity, which then solidifies to form the finished product. In case you are interested in learning more about this process, its steps, main advantages, as well as needed tools and materials, we suggest that you take a look at [Xometry’s ultimate guide to injection molding](https://www.xometry.com/ultimate-guide/injection-molding/).

Due to the delicacy of the process and its wide application, there's a lot of space for costly mistakes that can compromise the integrity and performance of the produced item. This article will go through most of the defects in injection molding, together with different ways to prevent and avoid them.

## Type 1: Injection Molding Defects Caused by Molding Process

[Type 1 defects](https://www.rapiddirect.com/blog/injection-molding-defects) appear most frequently since, generally speaking, defects in injection molding items are most commonly caused by the injection molding process itself. However, by altering the temperature, flow rate, or other mold settings, such errors can be easily prevented

### Flow Lines

Flow lines are stains, patterns, or lines that appear on thinner areas of the molded component, frequently of a slightly different color than the surrounding area. They can also appear on a product's surface as ring-shaped bands near the mold's entry points. Even though flow markings usually don’t affect the component's integrity, they are unpleasant and undesirable, especially on products that have to be appealing to the eye.

One of the [main causes for flow lines](https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/injection-molding-defects-and-how-to-prevent) is the variations in the material's cooling rate as it flows in different directions within the mold. Another reason is wall thickness – if there is no uniform thickness of the walls, the material cools and solidifies at different speeds. Moreover, a slow injection speed or low-pressure molding can also be a reason for any unwanted flow lines that might appear.

One of the methods that manufacturers use in order to prevent this type of injection molding defect is to make sure that the material fills the mold before cooling. This can be done by increasing the pressure, speed, and material temperature to the recommended optimal level. In addition, they round corners and points where the wall thickness varies to avoid abrupt changes in direction and flow rate. In an effort to prevent the material from cooling too quickly, mold gates can be relocated such that the distance between them and the mold coolant is greater. Namely, [mold gates](http://www.aimprocessing.com/blog/plastic-injection-molding-gate-basics) are the openings through which the polymer solution is fed into the final item, while a [mold coolant](https://info.crescentind.com/blog/cooling-methods-and-design-in-injection-molding) is a substance that is used to regulate and reduce the temperature in the mold as needed.

### Burn Marks

This injection molding defect appears as black or rust-colored discoloration on the molded part's surface or edge. Burn marks do not usually compromise the integrity of the item, but they may become a problem once the item is burnt to a point of degradation.

Burn marks are most commonly caused by overheating of trapped air bubbles or resin in the mold during the injection. This happens due to either high injection rates or excessive heating of the material itself.

The most important [prevention method for this defect](https://plasticranger.com/top-10-injection-molding-defects-and-how-to-prevent-them/) is simply reducing the melt and mold temperature and the injection speed of the molding tool. Moreover, manufacturers are trying to avoid burn marks by adding exhaust systems and expanding the gas vents so that trapped air can escape easily during the low-pressure injection. Last, but not least, they might try to shorten the molding cycle time, i.e. the injection and cooling time, such that any trapped air or resin does not overheat.

### Sink Marks

[Sink marks are small depressions or craters](https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/what-cause-injection-molding-defects-and-how-to-fix-them) that appear on the thicker parts of a molded part's otherwise flat and consistent surface. They commonly occur when the interior part of a molded component shrinks, which causes the material to pull from the outside inward.

The main reason for these defects is insufficient cooling time or the cooling mechanism for the plastic to properly cool and cure while in the mold. Inadequate mold cavity pressure or a high temperature at the gate can also cause sink marks. As mentioned, they mostly appear on thicker parts, since thicker areas of the injection molded part take longer to cool than thin ones.

There exist several different steps that may be taken in order to prevent sink marks from appearing. First of all, the cooling time should be increased to reduce shrinkage. Moreover, the thickness of the thickest wall parts should be reduced, thus providing shorter cooling times. To allow for more sufficient cooling and curing, mold temperatures should be reduced, holding pressure increased, and holding duration extended.

### Warping

This deformation happens when different sections of the molded part shrink disproportionately. Plastic and other materials can warp during the cooling process in the same manner as wood can warp when it dries unevenly. As a result, the shape of the item is twisted, uneven, or curved in places where it wasn't supposed to be.

Premature and rapid cooling is one of the major causes of warping. Excessive warmth and a material's low thermal conductivity can also lead to warpage. In other cases, since the shrinkage increases proportionally with wall thickness, the mold design is to be blamed for this type of defect.

To prevent warping from happening, the manufacturer has to make sure that the cooling process is gradual and lengthy enough. Additionally, they should know which type of material to use - some materials are less prone to shrinking during cooling, such as particle-filled thermoplastics, in contrast to semi-crystalline materials or unfilled grades. Another solution would be to redesign the mold with consistent wall thickness and symmetry, in order to achieve better component stability during cooling.

## Type 2: Injection Molding Defects Related to Storage or Materials Used

Injection molding errors can also develop due to the material itself or due to the way the manufacturer stores and preprocesses it. These deformations might vary from small cosmetic faults to compromised strength of the molded part. Depending on the intended application of the product in question, serious safety risks may potentially arise.

### Delamination

Delamination is a surface layer flaking injection molding defect that occurs when thin layers on the surface of a molded component readily separate or peel away from the underlying material. Since it reduces the component’s strength, it is generally regarded as a serious problem.

The most prevalent cause of delamination is foreign material contamination of the resin pellets or other base material. When two materials cannot adequately bind to each other, flaky separation occurs. Aside from the material injected into the hopper, any extra release agents covering the mold for better component separation might potentially be contaminated. Delamination can also be caused by excessive moisture on the material as a result of insufficient drying before usage.

There are various ways to prevent delamination, depending on what caused it. First of all, resin pallets must be properly stored and handled at all times. If the release agents are the problem, the manufacturer should try to decrease the reliance on them by redesigning the mold and putting an emphasis on the injection nozzle. In case of excess moisture, the mold temperature should be increased or the material should be adequately pre-dried.

### Discoloration

When a molded object has a different color than expected, it is referred to as discoloration or "color streaking." This defect is often restricted to a small region or a few streaks of abnormal color. Even though discoloration does not affect the product's strength, it does affect its aesthetics.

Residual resin in the nozzle, stale pallets in the hopper, or a mold from a previous production run are all common causes of discoloration. Other probable factors include poor heat conductivity of the coloring component or improper masterbatch mixing.

In order to make sure discoloration doesn’t happen, any residual resins or ingredients should be eliminated by ensuring that the machine, hopper, nozzle, and mold are cleaned correctly between each manufacturing cycle. The manufacturer should make sure that the color agent that’s being used has excellent heat conductivity, i.e. can withstand high temperatures. Furthermore, the masterbatch should be equally blended so that consistent color output is ensured.

## Type 3: Injection Molding Defects Caused by Maintenance or Poor Mold Design

The third type of defect that might happen during injection molding is caused by either bad mold design or improper mold maintenance. Since such errors occur in the final phases of the injection molding process, addressing them can be very challenging

### Flash

Flash, also known as "burrs" or "spew", is an excess of molding material that appears as a protrusion at the component’s edge. Flash happens when the material flows outside of the specified flow channels and into the gap between the tooling plates or at the injector pin. Even though this defect is subtle most of the time, it can become a major problem in case it is visible.

Flash can occur when the mold isn't clamped tightly enough (strong enough to withstand the opposing pressures created by the molten plastic flowing through the mold), allowing the plastic to seep through. Furthermore, if the injection pressure is too high, the plastic may be forced out by the path of least resistance. However, the primary cause of this injection molding defect is poor mold condition or maintenance.

Increasing the clamping force on the plate to keep the material in the channel is one way to prevent flashes from happening. Other methods might include increasing the material flow, as well as adjusting the mold temperature, injection pressure, and ventilation. Moreover, repairs and maintenance are required on a regular basis to keep the mold in excellent working order at all times.

### Short shots

Short shots, as the name indicates, are scenarios in which the molding shot goes short. These defects are one of the most dangerous injection molding defects, since they may drastically alter the desired look of the molded object or prevent it from performing its intended function. Short shots happen when the material is unable to fill the mold's cavities, thus resulting in an incomplete product once it completely cools down.

A variety of factors might result in short shots. If the shot is incorrectly calibrated, the plastic material may be insufficient to fill the voids. If the plastic is overly viscous, it may harden before it has filled all of the holes, resulting in a short shot. In case of inadequate degassing or gas venting methods, trapped air has no way to leave, and the plastic material cannot occupy the area that air or gas already occupies, which again results in short shots.

One of the most common solutions for this defect is to enhance the flow of the material through the mold. This can be done by either redesigning the mold with broader channels and gates, increasing the injection speed and pressure, or by using a thinner base material. To keep the material from cooling too quickly, the temperature in the mold should be increased. Moreover, more air vents should be added or the existing ones should be widened so that trapped air has an easier way to escape. Another thing that manufacturers should be careful about is the selection of plastic material. Namely, a plastic that is less viscous and has better flowability should be used so that it can fill the hardest-to-reach cavities.
