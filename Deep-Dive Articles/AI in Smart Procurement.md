# AI in smart procurement

In the age of automation and digitalization_, smart procurement_ is experiencing a rise in popularity due to its ability to help companies advance and gain a competitive advantage.

Throughout the years, it has become evident that _procurement_ plays an important role in shaping the company’s future since its growth and overall success are influenced by the capabilities, knowledge, productivity, and efficiency of the CPOs (Chief Procurement Officer) and their teams, among other factors. Yet, a huge amount of the procurement professionals’ time is spent on simple administrative tasks and processes that can and should be automated. Moreover, the extensive scope and complexity of the data they’re dealing with amplifies the wastage of time and makes the job a real organizational and bureaucratic burden. So, the need for a quicker, more efficient, and less time-consuming way of dealing with such tasks has arisen.

And this is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes into the picture. _Artificial intelligence_ is ubiquitous and is rapidly changing the way we live, think, and do things. In fact, [a recent study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-the-state-of-ai-in-2020) conducted in 2020 by McKinsey & Company reveals that half of the respondents have already adopted AI in at least one function within their businesses. As David Khuat-Duy, the CEO of Ivalua, [explains](https://www.sourcetoday.com/supply-chain/article/21867095/4-ways-artificial-intelligence-impacts-procurement), “There is clearly a huge appetite for AI, and this will only increase as more relevant applications and success stories come to light”. However, according to the aforementioned study, a relatively low percentage of executives (around 9%) have implemented AI in the procurement sector.

One of the reasons behind this lies in the people’s natural instinct to resist change. Another reason may be the scary headlines that represent AI as a two-headed dragon that will take over the world and steal people’s jobs. However, the truth is some of the doubts are very much justified since making procurement smart is a double-edged sword. More specifically, if not implemented appropriately, it may make processes even more complicated and laborious. However, CEOs are yet to sober up and understand that no matter how AI is applied and utilized, it is completely powerless and useless without the knowledge, experience, and leadership of humans.

In the scope of this article, we will discuss the two distinct definitions of smart procurement and give an overview of the types of artificial intelligence implemented within the procurement department, along with some of their use cases.

## What is Smart Procurement?

Giving a simple, short, and concrete definition of smart procurement is a rather challenging task since the term has two distinctive and exceedingly extensive meanings. The first interpretation of smart procurement, and the older one, involves corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives such as environment protection, resource conservation, and fair treatment of people. That’s why, when used in this context, smart procurement can be also called [socially responsible procurement](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/07/socially-responsible-procurement-doing-the-right-things-for-everyone/). In essence, the main objective of this type of procurement is to effectively maintain a balance between profitable performance and ethical behavior towards society.

The newer version of smart procurement, on the other hand, involves advanced analytics, visualization, robotic process automation (RPA), big data, and artificial intelligence with all of its subcategories. However, making procurement “smart” does not mean that it should depend solely on machines and algorithms. In fact, the end goal is to use AI for dull, basic, and low-complexity tasks, thus allowing the procurement professionals to focus more on jobs that are pivotal, rewarding, and of higher value.

## Types of AI in Smart Procurement

By now, it is as clear as day that AI can, and in fact, _is_ transforming procurement for the better. However, when we say AI, we mean any algorithm exhibiting any behavior that is considered “smart”. This is obviously a very broad definition, so we will get into more detail and take a look at some of its types.

1. **Machine Learning (ML)**

It is defined as an algorithm that detects patterns and uses them for making predictions and decisions. It is the most commonly used, yet the most misunderstood type of AI. There are many different definitions of [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning), since some people consider it as advanced statistics and mathematics, while others picture it as human-like machines.

When it comes to procurement, machine learning is used for solving various challenges and improving operational efficiency by utilizing automated statistics. Some of its [usages](https://sievo.com/resources/ai-in-procurement#examples-of-artificial-intelligence-in-procurement) in the procurement sector are:

- Spend classification – this is one of the oldest and most difficult challenges in procurement spend analytics. By using supervised machine learning algorithms, millions of unique transactions can be categorized and sub-categorized according to data gathered from invoices, purchase orders and, other sources of data.
- Anomaly detection – the ability to detect defects quickly and efficiently is very important for the survival and growth of any organization. In this way, the procurement team can find out unexpected patterns and disruptions in the system like changes in purchase prices or transportation costs.
- Vendor matching – machine learning helps in this by connecting supplier data to a vendor hierarchy. [Vendor matching](https://planergy.com/blog/what-is-3-way-matching/) is a beneficial business practice since it saves businesses money, prepares businesses for audits, and it ensures optimal vendor relationships.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

[NLP](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-guide-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-48ea2511f6e1) is solely focused on the human language, or more concretely, on its understanding, interpretation, and manipulation. There are many practical applications of NLP in the field of procurement, ranging from uncovering important insights from past data to automating time—consuming processes. More specifically, NLP can be used in procurement for:

- Generation of chat bots and virtual assistants – they rely on natural language generation (NLG) and their purpose is to give fast and explanatory responses to easy questions that otherwise have to be answered manually. In this way, CPOs put much less effort into figuring out things such as the total amount of money the company has spent on a given supplier in a specific year, or the company’s exposure to a particular country.
- Analysis of invoice descriptions – the main idea is to do a text-related interpretation of invoices, such as analysis of text fields in purchase orders or identification of groups of purchased items based on their category. This can be achieved by utilizing [word embeddings](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/) – a conventional representation of document vocabulary in a format that is comprehensible for the computer. In fact, each word in the document is represented by a real-valued vector in a predefined vector space. The approach is based on a distributed representation of the words learned from their usages. So, words that are used in similar ways have more similar representations and vice versa, thus capturing their meaning, context, and semantics in terms of numbers.
- Contract management – since contracts contain lots of valuable information, being able to manage them all the way from their creation up until their execution is of utmost importance for any company. By using [contract management software](https://www.medius.com/glossary/what-is-contract-management/), all contracts can be digitized and stored into a single central repository, allowing stakeholders such as legal and compliance departments to search for and analyze contracts without having to comb through stacks of paper.
3. **Big Data**

[Big data](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/big-data) is a collection of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data that is being collected by organizations in order to be used for predictive modeling, advanced analytics, and various machine learning projects. Generally speaking, big data is defined as data that is hugely diverse, abundant, and arrives with more velocity.

One of the major problems of modern companies is not the insufficiency of data, but rather its poor quality. Procurement, finance, and supply chain business leaders believe that this is one of the biggest challenges of adopting AI. To back this up with numbers, we can take a look at [recent research](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180605005066/en/Organizations-Set-Major-Procurement-Supply-Chain-AI) conducted by Forrester Consulting, which revealed that more than half of the respondents, or 59% to be exact, believe that poor data quality will negatively influence the accuracy of the AI algorithms and prevent them from making faultless and informed decisions.

So, in order to solve the problem of inconsistency and poor quality of data, smart procurement technologies need to be integrated into the organizations’ systems. These platforms may gather and combine important data from a variety of sources, such as risk calculations, internal performance scorecards, and external financial numbers, into one place. After big data has been collected and unified, it can afterward be used by AI for identifying leakage or pinpointing growing trends. Some of its [use cases](https://www.procurementexpress.com/blog/how-smart-companies-are-bringing-big-data-to-procurement/) are:

- More accurate forecasting –procurement is a lot more complicated and strategic than simply shopping, so having precise predictions about the future is very beneficial in order to make informed decisions.
- Better compliance – in the context of procurement, compliance refers to making sure that the organization follows the established rules. The main goal of compliance is to measure the ability of the company to stick to the predefined budget and meet the contract terms while at the same time monitor the performance of the suppliers.
- Improved transparency - 65% of procurement leaders say that they have limited visibility into their supply chain, according to [Deloitte’s 2018 Chief Procurement Officer Survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/operations/articles/cpo-survey.html). That’s why improving transparency is a key factor in decreasing the doubts and worries of the CPOs and enabling better and faster detection of risk factors such as potential transportation issues or material shortages.
- Analytics - insightful analytics is a necessary piece of the puzzle when it comes to smart procurement. A detailed description of analytics is given below.

4. **Advanced Analytics**

As previously explained, big data helps in binding external and internal data sources together, thus making advanced analysis possible and more informative. As a matter of fact, [65% of CPOs](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/operations/articles/cpo-survey.html) believe that analytics will have the largest impact on future organizational performance<sup>6</sup>.

The main purpose of [advanced analytics](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/advanced-analytics) is to make recommendations, gain insights and make predictions by utilizing automated or semi-automated analysis of data and content. Some of the main use cases are:

- Risk analysis – identifying business risks such as pricing risk, compliance risk, geographical risk, and disaster risk. Additionally, it aids in the definition of preventative measures and the detection of countermeasures in order to properly cope with risk situations.
- Data mining – helping procurement in better understanding external trends, spending, and supplier performance by analyzing large amounts of data and thus deriving meaningful and useful insights.
- Predictive analytics – understanding what the most probable outcomes are based on current conditions. Procurement can predict spend based on expected business changes and pricing depending on external variables.

## Summary

Evidently, artificial intelligence has made its way into numerous departments within organizations and has recently gained ground in the procurement department as well. This is great news for the CPOs and the procurement teams, since this means that they will be able to focus on the more important tasks, thus increasing their productivity and efficiency, and leave the generic and trivial tasks to the AI algorithms.

As explained, if there exists a sufficient amount of good quality data, AI can significantly improve the organization’s processes, decrease fraud and help in the identification of suitable suppliers. However, the most valuable advantage of AI is the ability to analyze and bring actionable insights to the fingertips of CPOs.

Even though smart procurement is not yet very widely accepted and implemented, it won’t be long until it becomes an inevitable part of any organization, due to its immense power and capability to add value to the organizations.
