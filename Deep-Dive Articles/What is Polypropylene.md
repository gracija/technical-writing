# Polypropylene is the World's Most Widely Used Plastic

Polypropylene is a semi-rigid, cost-effective, and tough thermoplastic linear hydrocarbon polymer resin that offers excellent chemical, electrical, and fatigue resistance at high temperatures. It is considered a hazard-free plastic and as such, it has been used for the [production of various products](https://adrecoplastics.co.uk/polypropylene-uses/#:~:text=In%20its%20fibre%20form%2C%20polypropylene,effective%20for%20the%20marine%20sector.) ranging from plastic furniture and machinery to pill containers and syringes. Despite its versatility, customizability, and strength, this material has some disadvantages as well, such as its proneness to oxidation, high flammability, and sensitivity to chlorinated solvents and aromatics.

Polypropylene is a low-density, stress-resistant thermoplastic made from a propene monomer. Polypropylene is manufactured by polymerizing propylene gas using a catalyst system, commonly a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalyst. This material finds its place in numerous industries; the medical, automotive, packaging, electrical, construction, and food industries to name a few. Polypropylene is BPA-free plastic and as such is considered a better alternative than other plastics, especially in the foodservice and packaging industries. Since there are no known cancer-causing effects associated with polypropylene, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of this polymer as a food and beverage container material.

## What is Polypropylene?

Polypropylene (PP) is a low-density, stress-resistant thermoplastic made from a propene (or propylene) monomer. The chemical formula for this linear hydrocarbon resin is (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)n. It was discovered in the mid-1950s by Italian scientists and is today the [second most commonly manufactured plastic](https://omnexus.specialchem.com/selection-guide/polypropylene-pp-plastic) after polyethylene.

Polypropylene is a ‘’thermoplastic’’ material and as such, it can be heated to its melting point, chilled, and then reheated again without any major deterioration. This property, together with its ability to liquefy instead of burn when subjected to high temperatures, are two important attributes that make polypropylene a popular choice for manufacturers. Some other [characteristics of this material](https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/all-about-polypropylene-pp-plastic) are:

- Resistance to Chemicals: Polypropylene is resistant to diluted bases and acids, making it an ideal choice for containers that hold liquids such as cleaning solutions.
- Toughness: Polypropylene has elasticity over a limited range of deflection, but it can be also considered a “tough” material since it experiences plastic distortion early in the deformation process. [Toughness](https://www.industrialheating.com/articles/89754-toughness) refers to a material's capacity to absorb energy and bend without cracking.
- Insulation: Polypropylene has a high electrical resistance, making it ideal for electronic components.

## How is Polypropylene Made?

Polypropylene is made by polymerizing propylene gas using a catalyst system, commonly a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalyst. The polymerization parameters - temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations are all determined according to the desired polymer grade. There exist several [different manufacturing methods](https://www.valcogroup-valves.com/faq-2/pp-polypropylene-manufacturing-process-of-pp-polypropylene/#:~:text=Polypropylene%20is%20made%20from%20the,polymer%20grade%20to%20be%20produced.) that may occur in either gas-phase or liquid-phase process:

- Gas-phase Process: The reaction happens in a fluidized bed reactor at a temperature of 70°C to 100°C and a pressure of 1-20 atm. Propane and hydrogen are transported over this catalytic bed. Propene is converted to polypropylene as a fine powder, which is then separated from unreacted propene and hydrogen using cyclone separators. In the end, this fine powder is pelletized and is then ready for further usage. In general, gas-phase polymerization efficiency can be improved by using high-activity catalysts to eliminate gaseous and aqueous effluents.
- Spheripol Process: This polymerization process employs propene, ethylene, and hydrogen in order to produce polypropylene. The reaction happens by suspending the catalyst and monomer units in an inert solvent, such as light hydrocarbons. The monomer and catalyst slurry is pumped into one or two vertical stirred gas phase reactors where polymerization takes place. Once the polymerization is completed, the mixture of monomers and polymer powder is discharged from the reactors through dip tubes, while the unreacted monomer is recycled back into the stirred gas reactor. The polymer is then stored for later use.

## What Are the Uses of Polypropylene?

Polypropylene is most commonly used for:

- Material Handling
- Packaging
- Medical devices
- Clothing
- Car Parts
- Housewares
- Toys

Because of its chemical resistance, weldability, and other useful properties, this material finds its place in [numerous industries](https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/all-about-polypropylene-pp-plastic); the medical, automotive, packaging, electrical, construction, and food industries to name a few. The packaging industry has been using polypropylene as a substitute for paper and cellophane, mostly due to its low cost and flexibility. Pallets, bottles, jars, yogurt containers, hot beverage cups, and food packaging are some of the products made with this material. Polypropylene is frequently utilized in the automotive industry for the production of batteries, bumpers, instrument panels, interior elements, and door trims. Because of its chemical, bacterial, and steam sterilization resistance, polypropylene is employed in a variety of medical applications as well, such as disposable syringes, diagnostic devices, Petri dishes, intravenous bottles, and pill containers.

Even though there exist several different ways to process polypropylene and plastics in general, [injection molding](https://www.protolabs.com/services/injection-molding/polypropylene/) is the most dominantly used manufacturing procedure among all. Polypropylene responds swiftly to injection speed and pressure, and it forms up quickly in the mold, allowing molders to achieve high production rates. Due to its mix of performance attributes, this polymer has a very important position in the injection molding market in general.

### What Are the Advantages of Using Polypropylene?

Some of the main advantages of polypropylene include:

- Widely accessible and cost-effective
- High flexural strength due to its semi-crystalline structure
- High resistance to moisture absorption and fatigue
- Great electrical insulator
- Chemically resistant to a variety of bases and acids

### What Are the Disadvantages of Using Polypropylene?

On the other hand, the main disadvantages of polypropylene include:

- Susceptible to UV deterioration
- Sensitive to aromatics and chlorinated solvents
- Highly flammable
- Prone to oxidation
- Difficult to paint due to its poor bonding qualities

However, in most use case scenarios, the benefits outweigh the downsides and that’s why this material is still very widely used in various industries.

## How Does Polypropylene Affect Human Health?

Polypropylene doesn't affect human health except as potentially a mild irritant. Some plastics, such as those containing [BPA](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-bpa#basics) (Bisphenol-A) or other toxic chemicals, can harm our bodies or the environment in which we live. Polypropylene, however, is BPA-free plastic and as such is considered a better alternative than other plastics, especially in the food service and packaging industries. Based on the kind of resin used, all plastics have a 'Resin Identification Code/ Plastic Recycling Code,' and polypropylene’s code is 5. Despite being considered safe, [potential health issues](https://www.medicinenet.com/is_polypropylene_toxic_to_humans/article.htm) might arise if, for example, the material’s powder gets in contact with the person’s eyes or skin, since it may cause irritation. Moreover, PP ingestion might cause minor gastrointestinal discomfort and disruptions. Inhalation of particles might also cause problems, i.e. respiratory irritation. All of these possible health risks are very unlikely to happen and because of this, polypropylene is considered the safest plastic of all.

### Is Polypropylene toxic?

Polypropylene is generally not considered toxic since it is not known to cause cancer or any other serious condition that may affect human health. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of this polymer as a food and beverage container material. It's worth noting, though, that some recent research suggests that certain polypropylene containers may be harmful. In a [2019 study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.9b02293), researchers looked at several types of plastic in a variety of items. Because of the manufacturing process of each product, they discovered that the toxicity of a specific plastic varied substantially from product to product. The researchers of this study discovered that [some polypropylene products affected androgen hormones](https://www.healthline.com/health/is-polypropylene-safe#is-it-bpa-free) and induced a toxic or stress response in cells. However, The FDA and EPA's recommendations for the usage of polypropylene have not been altered as a result of this study. Moreover, there has been evidence of common food containers made with polypropylene [leaching some endocrine-disrupting chemicals](https://www.medicinenet.com/is_polypropylene_toxic_to_humans/article.htm). Heat, duration of contact, and acidity of the food or drink all contribute to leaching from plastic food containers.

### What Is the Difference Between Polypropylene and Polystyrene?

The main difference between polystyrene and polypropylene is that polystyrene's monomer is styrene, whereas polypropylene's monomer is propylene. Furthermore, polystyrene's pendant group is a phenyl group, whereas polypropylene's pendant group is a methyl group. The tacticity of the polymer is determined by these attached groups. Let us now take a look at a brief outline of these two materials’ [key characteristics](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-polystyrene-and-vs-polypropylene/#:~:text=The%20key%20difference%20between%20polystyrene,repeating%20units%20are%20%E2%80%9Cmonomers%E2%80%9D.) which separate them from one another:

- Production Process: Polypropylene is made by chain-growth polymerization, while polystyrene is manufactured by free radical vinyl polymerization.
- Uses: Single-use drinking cups, household appliances, and computer housing parts are made of polystyrene, whereas polypropylene is utilized to make containers, packaging, and automobile parts.
- [Chemical Resistance](https://www.m2sci.com/blog/polypropylene-vs-polystyrene/): Polystyrene has some acid and base resistance, although not as much as polypropylene against some chemicals.
- Reusability: Polystyrene products are typically used in huge amounts and are disposed of after one use since they cannot tolerate temperatures beyond 100°C.  Unlike polystyrene, polypropylene items may be reused many times.

### What Is the Difference Between Polypropylene and Polyester?

The fundamental difference between polyester and polypropylene is that polyester can absorb some water whereas polypropylene cannot. Both polypropylene and polyester are polymer materials but are utilized in different scenarios depending on the chemical and physical properties that the final product should have. Let us now take a look at a brief outline of these two materials’ [key characteristics](https://www.thecreativefolk.com/polyester-vs-polypropylene/) which separate them from one another:

- Production Process: Polypropylene is made by the addition polymerization of propylene, while polyester is created by condensation polymerization between a diol and a dicarboxylic acid.
- UV and Heat Resistance: Polypropylene can start degrading when exposed to UV rays and extremely high temperatures for a longer period of time, while polyester can sustain greater temperatures and is UV resistant.
- **Moisture Absorption: Because it distributes moisture rather than absorbing it, polypropylene is more water-resistant than polyester and as such, it is a good option for athletic wear.**
- **Cost: Although polypropylene is often less expensive to manufacture than polyester, this does not always imply that the finished product will be less expensive. The pricing is heavily influenced by factors such as brand names and product categories.**
- **Uses:** Polypropylene is mostly used in the packaging industry, while polyester is more commonly utilized in the textile industry
