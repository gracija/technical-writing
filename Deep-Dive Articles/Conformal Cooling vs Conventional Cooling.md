# Conformal Cooling vs. Conventional Cooling: Differences and Comparison

Conformal cooling and conventional cooling are the two primary techniques that are being used in the cooling phase of the injection molding process. They both rely on the same idea of utilizing coolant channels, with the main difference being in the way these channels are designed and machined. More specifically, conventional cooling entails the use of straight cooling channels that, regardless of the shape of the object, are typically placed in the middle of the object. On the other hand, the channels that are used in conformal cooling closely conform to the geometry of the molded item, reaching its most inaccessible regions. This allows for more uniform cooling of the items molded with the latter technique, which directly translates to less stress, and inherently, fewer deformations and aesthetic flaws.

Another important difference is in the way these channels are created – for conventional cooling, this is done via traditional drilling and milling, while for conformal cooling, the most frequently used technology is 3D printing. Due to the restricted amount of materials that can be 3D printed, conformal cooling is a bit more limited in terms of choosing the right raw material for one’s needs.

The biggest reason why many manufacturers still avoid implementing conformal cooling channels within their applications is the cost – initially, this technology would require a bigger investment than using conventional cooling channels. However, despite the higher price and relatively higher amount of time needed for creating an optimal design, using conformal cooling should be way faster and cheaper in the long run, especially in the cases of high-volume manufacturing.

This article will cover all important information regarding both technologies, along with their similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Conformal Cooling Definition and Comparison to Conventional Cooling

Conformal cooling is the process of utilizing coolant channels in plastic injection mold tools that curve and closely follow the geometry of the component to be produced. Conformal cooling channels were proposed in the 1990s with the intent of reducing the deformation of the molded objects and shortening cooling times.  A conformally cooled mold may be produced using a number of techniques, some of which are vacuum brazing and liquid interface diffusion. However, the most commonly used technology for producing conformal cooling channels is metal 3D printing, or more specifically - direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). DMLS is an additive manufacturing technique that creates items from 3D CAD models with incredibly complex exterior and interior geometries by layer-by-layer melting of metal powder with a directed laser beam in strata as thin as 40 m. This additive manufacturing technology was invented in 1984 by Chuck Hull

In most cases, conformal cooling is preferred over conventional cooling because the channels in this technique are not limited to the straight, line-of-sight holes, that is, they follow the curves and bends of intricate component designs. This results in much better cooling efficiency and quicker cycle times, among other important benefits that we will explain in more detail later on.

### What Are the Advantages of Conformal Cooling Compared to Conventional Cooling?

Conformal cooling has the following advantages over conventional cooling:

·        Conformal cooling consumes less raw material than conventional cooling.

·        Conformal cooling offers an enhanced aesthetic finish due to a more uniform cooling of the surface of the cavity.

·        Conformal cooling reduces cycle time as a result of the tool's lower heating and cooling times.

·        Conformal cooling reduces residual stress, which leads to less warpage of the molded item.

·        Conformal cooling allows the production of free-form shapes that would not have been possible with conventional cooling techniques.

### What Are the Disadvantages of Conformal Cooling Compared to Conventional Cooling?

Listed below are some major disadvantages of conformal cooling vs. conventional cooling:

·        Conformal cooling is more expensive than conventional cooling very often, especially when employing an additive manufacturing technique.

·        Conformal cooling requires more careful engineering than conventional cooling, which involves using advanced analytical tools for choosing the best design for effectively drawing away heat.

·        Conformal cooling tools’ size is constrained by the print bed, which is often smaller than a conventional machined equivalent.

## Conventional Cooling Definition and Comparison to Conformal Cooling

Conventional cooling, sometimes referred to as standard or traditional cooling, involves the machining of straight cooling channels into the mold tool using conventional techniques like drilling or milling. This cooling system is the initial system that has been used in the injection molding process and has been invented long before the conformal cooling technique.

Even though the channels produced by these methods are made in straight lines, they may cross or be strengthened by extra components such as baffles, bubblers, and thermal pins. A baffle is a cooling channel that runs perpendicular to a main cooling line, with a blade dividing it into two semi-circular passages. Coolant from the main cooling line enters one side of the blade, goes around the tip to the opposite side of the baffle, and then returns to the main cooling line. In contrast to a baffle, a bubbler has a tiny tube instead of the abovementioned blade Baffles and bubblers both work to expand the area of the item that a coolant may reach. The thermal pin, a replacement for the baffle and bubbler, is a sealed cylinder filled with a fluid that removes heat from the mold, vaporizes, and then condenses back to liquid once coolant reaches it.

 One of the biggest problems of the conventional cooling system is its inability to remove heat uniformly from components with complicated geometries since it is difficult or even impossible to place cooling channels near corners and huge, cored-out features. Therefore, the traditional cooling channel design is best suited for parts with relatively simple geometries to guarantee that the entire molded component is properly and uniformly cooled.

### What Are the Advantages of Conventional Cooling Compared to Conformal Cooling?

Some of the main advantages that conventional cooling has over conformal cooling are:

·        Conventional cooling channels usually take less time to engineer than conformal cooling channels, due to the latter one requiring more sophisticated analysis software to determine the optimal design.

·        Conventional cooling channels can be produced from a larger variety of materials, while conformal cooling channels are more limited since not all materials can be 3D printed.

### What Are the Disadvantages of Conventional Cooling Compared to Conformal Cooling?

Conventional cooling has the following disadvantages compared to conformal cooling:

·        Conventional cooling results in worse quality of the part produced rather than conformal cooling, especially when the part is of complex design or shape.

·        Conventional cooling has a bigger cycle time compared to conformal cooling.

·        Using conventional cooling systems has higher overall costs as-to conformal cooling systems, or more specifically, the DMLS technique, especially when it comes to high-volume production of molded parts.

Conformal cooling is the right choice when molding parts with complex geometries, while conventional cooling should be used when the parts have long and flat geometries. Both technologies rely on the usage of cooling channels and cooling agents, but conformal cooling offers a more uniform cooling of the item that is being molded, which inherently results in improved overall aesthetics.

### Conformal Cooling vs. Conventional Cooling: Lead Cost Comparison

Until recently, the main issue with conformal cooling was its cost because the manufacturing processes behind it were just too expensive to balance against the advantages. Direct metal laser sintering, however, has changed this by making conformal cooling channels both affordable and easy to produce. The DMLS method, which is based on 3D printing, is still likely to be more expensive than conventional cooling, but it can result in significant cost savings for high-volume manufacturing, more than making up for the initial tool cost. Therefore, we can conclude that the bigger the number of items we are to produce, the more it will pay off to employ conformal cooling channels. In other words, conformal cooling often increases the cost of the mold, but will probably result in reduced overall operating costs.

### Conformal Cooling vs. Conventional Cooling: Speed Comparison

Since cooling usually takes up more than half of the entire cycle time and can exponentially increase production time, it is a stage in the injection molding process that has to be carefully controlled. Conformal cooling is expected to require more time when it comes to engineering the 3D printed tool since it has to be done very delicately to determine the optimal design. However, once the 3D design has been optimized, the process of printing and post-finishing a tool or insert can be completed in a couple of days as opposed to weeks for traditional tools. That is mostly because the channels can more closely follow the shape of the mold and can speed up the cooling of hardly reachable areas that would be way further away from traditional, straight channels. As a matter of fact, by using the conformal cooling channels system, mold designers may anticipate cycle time savings of up to even 70% at times.

### Conformal Cooling vs. Conventional Cooling: Volume Comparison

With the conformal cooling system, a higher production volume of items may be achieved within a given fixed timeframe compared to a conventional cooling system, due to the shorter overall cycle times of the injection molding process. Moreover, when employing conformal cooling channels, the production costs decrease as the number of items that are being produced increases. Since the initial cost for designing and creating the mold is much higher with conformal cooling, this technology is more adequate for high-volume manufacturing, while conventional cooling is the right choice for low-volume production.

### Conformal Cooling vs. Conventional Cooling: Materials Comparison

The first material available for making conformal cooling channels with the most commonly used method, DMLS, was a bronze alloy that is perfect for molds and inserts used in low and medium-volume manufacturing runs. Making tools for high-volume applications has also become possible with the introduction of EOS Maraging Steel MS1, ultrahigh-strength pre-alloyed steel in fine powder form. The necessary mold surface may be easily created from either of these materials via machining. However, the choice of raw materials that may be used for conventional cooling is much broader, since many typical tool steels, such as NAK80 or P20, aren't even accessible as 3D print media. On the other hand, it should be noted that conformal cooling generally uses fewer raw materials.

What Are the Mutual Alternatives to the Conformal Cooling and Conventional Cooling?

Apart from conformal and conventional cooling systems, there exist other, relatively advanced, cooling strategies that should be taken into consideration as alternatives to these two:

- **High Thermal Conductivity Inserts**: Inserts composed of a material with high thermal conductivity can be utilized to cool thin cored-out features. Normally, these inserts are press-fitted into the core and extend into the base of the mold, with cooling channels passing through them or just touching them. The two most widely used materials for inserts are aluminum and copper alloy.

- **Rapid Heating**: Rapid heating aims to immediately pre-heat the mold to the glass transition temperature of the polymer or above once the part is ejected. With the aid of this method, it is possible to produce surfaces with a high gloss, stronger weld lines, less aesthetically undesirable surface flaws, and lower injection pressures.

### What Are the Similarities Between Conformal Cooling and Conventional Cooling?

The similarities between conformal cooling and conventional cooling are:

- They are both used during the injection molding process for cooling the molten plastics inside the mold after the injection and pressure holding stages.

- They are both based on the fundamental concept of cooling channels that allow the flow of a cooling agent (such as coolant or water).
